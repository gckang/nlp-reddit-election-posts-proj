## Abstract
Current methods of analyzing sentiment of political social media posts are limited to training and analyzing based on. In this project, our group aims to fine-tune a model that can effectively generalize from previous Reddit posts concerning the 2020 election cycle to accurately predict affiliations and attitudes of posts from the current 2024 election cycle. Using a BERT model that is aligned towards performing sentiment analysis, our goal is to elucidate the social media behavior of voters and be able to speculate the outlook of the current political scene.
