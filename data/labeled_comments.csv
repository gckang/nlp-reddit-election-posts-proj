"Very true, but the problem is that even at that level there is mass corruption and brutality. Police forces have a lot of influence in local politics. But the influence of the president of the United States is at a whole different level, and if the problem is so glaring then it is also a glaring problem that our current president would rather sign executive orders related to twitter censoring his calls to violence (as is their right as a private company, as well as it being in accordance with their own terms of services which bind voluntary users.

You present no facts when you are smearing him.

He beat Bernie and everyone else.

He leads in polling.

He is from PA which is critical to win.

He is two time VP under one of the most popular presidents in Democrat history.

"Politically speaking, there is absolutely no way Biden could be seen refusing to take a picture with a young African-American person while visiting a police brutality protest.

I am sure this scenario was discussed before the final ""go"" decision to make the visit was made, and the visit was deemed worth the risk of contracting the virus.  If it wasn't, the alternative almost certainly wasn't to maintain a 6 foot bubble, it would have been to stay at home.

I'm not suggesting in any way that Joe didn't want to hang with these guys and take a picture with them.  He loves that kind of stuff.  He has a 40-plus year reputation in politics of being a guy who loves to get with the masses and shake some hands, slap some backs, and kiss some babies, hear their stories, and emphasize with their problems  He knew all the regulars on his train route home to Delaware each day during his years in the Senate by name and knew a lot of their families and other details about their lives just from chatting with him.

Honestly, I think he has probably really been having trouble being essentially confined to his home during this pandemic for that reason.  He felt a responsibility to provide a good example and be seen listening to and following the advice of the scientists and the doctors, though.  That was where he needed to be at that moment in history.

History is moving at lightning speed, however, and the protest was where he needed to be today.  He brought his mask, but strict social distancing in that sort of situation is tough for anyone, and impossible if you're running for President of the United States.

I feel you, though. I wouldn't be out there in any sort of mass gathering right now.  I get nervous about the possibility of accidentally coming closer than six feet to someone while walking my dog, or the minimal contact I need to make to pick up essential supplies (From my car).

Joe Biden is a brave guy, and has a special vocation right now.

I remember reading some inside stuff about recent Popes and they know their physical security precautions against individuals who mean them harm is not sufficient from a security point of view.  One Pope got tackled by some random person with a grudge as he was proceeding into Christmas Eve Mass during the opening hymn two years in a row.  That could have easily been much worse.  But they feel their vocations require them to take the risk.

Now, when and if he becomes President, there is going to be a different calculus surrounding Biden's decisions, and I think if something like this happened during his administration and it coincided with a pandemic, he'd probably be addressing the nation from the Oval Office and meeting with key protesters and police figures at the White House, where they would be tested for the virus, have their tempetures taken prior to entry, and have infrared cameras monitoring their body heat.

A challenger for the Presidency who is his party's presumptive nominee doesn't have the ability to or the luxury of taking those precautions at a big moment like this, though.  It's a tough position to be in, balancing the need to model good health concious behavior for the nation and the need to show support for the African-American community during an important time, but we should be glad he is willing to make the tough choices and hope he gets through the campaign without contracting the virus.  He won't do stupid things like Trump probably will be before the end of this and holding rallies in front of thousands of tens of thousands of people, but there will be moments where he is going to still have to be certain places and interact with the public in smaller groups like this. I don't envy him.

"Ok, I’m not gonna lie:

When Bernie was still in the race I wasn’t sure who would be better between him and Biden. I felt that my heart and core values aligned more closely with Bernie than they did Biden. That said, I thought about in 2016 when people who were really enthusiastic about Bernie did not vote in the 2016 election for one reason or another (They liked Bernie, uh... “too much???”... idk). That unsettled me. Though I figured that was a small issue, but Donald Trump won in 2016 and his shit show of a presidency followed. 

Now, I see those who wanted Bernie to be president have been denied, and they are not happy (the democratic process is a frustrating one for many, my friend) And I now must say that Bernie supporters who will not support Biden are simply helping a racist, stupid, incompetent, evil, corrupt, and all around authoritarian man stay in the top office of the land, continuing to erode its influence and reputation around the world and also erode the institutions within this nation that all Americans hold dear (justice dept., EPA, and all other agencies that have had their leadership swapped up and Trump allies and rich buddies holding the positions instead of competent leadership.).

"Dear Dr. Redfield,

We write to express significant concern regarding the recent decline in routine childhood immunization rates in the United States during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and urge you to take immediate action to encourage and support routine pediatric immunizations through the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to recent data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a decline in provider orders for non-influenza childhood vaccines, and measles-containing vaccines including the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, began one week after President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. [1] In May, the Michigan Care Improvement Registry found a drastic decrease in vaccination rates among children across nearly every age group. The percentage of children five months and younger who remain up-to-date on recommended vaccines declined from 67.9 percent in 2019, to 49.7 percent in May 2020.[2] The New York City health department reported a 63 percent drop in the number of vaccine doses administered to children between March 23 and May 9, including a 91 percent drop for children ages 2 and above.[3]

The administration of routine pediatric immunizations remains critical throughout the duration of this public health emergency. The decline in immunizations is largely attributable to efforts by families to adhere to social distancing guidelines to reduce both their exposure to, and the spread of COVID-19. But if this trend of decreased immunization rates among children continues, the United States could face yet another public health crisis: increased risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Such outbreaks would put lives at risk, and place additional stress on our health care system and public health infrastructure at a time when these systems are struggling to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To avoid this potential crisis, we urge the CDC to immediately develop an action plan that incorporates targeted public outreach and education efforts on addressing vaccine hesitancy and emphasizing the importance of pediatric immunizations; resources for communities that have seen reductions in their immunization rates since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; and guidance for parents and families on how to safely access pediatric immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic, including best practices regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) use and other precautions to limit the risk of exposure to COVID-19 in health care settings; and necessary efforts to ensure rapid catch-up for children who are not up to date on critical pediatric vaccines.

In addition to developing the plans described above, we request that you respond to the following questions no later than July 1, 2020 to help us better understand how the federal government is working to address the alarming drop in pediatric immunization rates: 


1.   What specific steps is CDC taking to reverse the dramatic drop in vaccinations since mid-March? 


a.   How does CDC plan to capture accurate real-time data on pediatric immunization rates and identify potential solutions, particularly in vulnerable communities? 


2.   What outreach and education efforts are underway at CDC to address fears among parents and families related to bringing children into health care settings during the COVID-19 crisis? 


a.   Is CDC planning a public information campaign to address vaccine hesitancy, and if so, how will CDC ensure that the necessary communication on the importance of routine immunizations is reaching parents and families?


b.   How will CDC ensure that families receive guidance on safe access to care for children during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the appropriate use of PPE? 


c.    How will CDC communicate with health care workers, and provide the necessary tools to inform communities about the importance of receiving pediatric immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic?


d     What guidance is CDC providing to pediatricians and other health care workers on procedures to ensure that they can safely provide and promote routine pediatric immunizations?


e.    Given the significant increase in unemployment due to COVID-19, many families are finding themselves uninsured. How will CDC raise awareness of the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program to ensure that families know their children can still access routine immunizations, and how does CDC plan to support participating VFC providers as they work to catch up VFC-eligible children on missed vaccinations, while also preparing for the upcoming flu season?


3.   How will CDC monitor the ongoing availability and ordering of pediatric immunizations, including doses and other essential medical devices, PPE, and other supplies needed to store, transport and administer vaccines, and what plans are in place to address any supply chain disruptions? 


a.   Is CDC taking steps now to ensure that the availability of pediatric immunizations, and necessary medical devices and supplies, is not impacted when production and domestic distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine is underway?


4.   Has CDC developed or reviewed modeling or projections that predict the potential impact on future vaccine-preventable outbreaks if the current pediatric immunization rate continues throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic? 


5.   Does CDC require additional resources from Congress in order to support efforts to reverse the decline in pediatric immunizations? If so, what level of funding would be sufficient?

I don’t think it should be a candidate’s job to get people excited.  Look at Canada.  The least exciting candidates, the reasonable, thoughtful, perhaps even quiet people, are often the best leaders. But people don’t vote for excitement. This isn’t the bachelor. 

Let’s stop expecting the election to look like a reality show, and be happy and excited to have reasonable people in office. 

I get it Bernie is an incredible man. I wish he was president.  But we can’t hold our leaders up to that level and be bitter if they’re not.  He’s a once in a lifetime candidate, and there are elections every four years.  You gotta make your expectations more reasonable.  I’m also really sad we missed out on Bernie. But Bernies excellence doesn’t diminish Biden as a good candidate. It’s a missed opportunity, but now we move on. 

And not to mention that we should be as ecstatic to get Trump out of office as much as the soldiers were when they heard WWII ended.  None of those soldiers thought, gee, I’m really sad about who they got to replace Hitler.

We're all just bleeding hearts, at the end of the day. But our hearts bleed for different causes, and different victims. That's why non-violent protests are the number 1 way to go right now, along with writing letters to our representatives. I'm not saying non-violent acts are effective 100% of the time when it comes to producing change, but they do end up being on the morally just side of history more often than the violent acts. They killed Lincoln, and he freed the slaves, and now people side with Lincoln. They killed MLK, and he promoted civil rights, and now people side with MLK. The killers just don't end up as the good guys, nor do they cause positive changes. Instead, violence begets violence, and the blame shifts to whoever is killing.

"Prosperity Jesus is the real savior of the American evangelical movement.  

I worked a contract for a bank where the lickspittle junior execs all went to the same megachurch the President of the bank attended.  It wasn't a move to increase their spirituality.  It was a move done hoping that the president of the bank would see them then reward them advancement based on it.  They judged the worth of others on their wealth and belittled the poor as lazy.

One of them not so gently asjed me to attend a service.  I said, ""No, thank you.  I'm Catholic and attend a great parish."".  Things changed for me and they made the next four months of my contract pretty unpleasant.  After reading my exit interview, the president of the bank wanted to say goodbye.  We had a good relationship and got things done.  A competitor had hired me and he wanted to counter.

So, I told him ""Thanks, but no thanks.  Your junior execs made life Hell for me because I didn't go to their megachurch.  Watch out for them.  They only go there to impress you.  Trust me, if you faltered, they would be the first with knives out and pointed at you."".

They think this is a war game and plainclothes people are the 'supposed' enemy and they will get the most points at any cost to put down innocent people, just because they are on the other side and in front of you!  

Police now, under trump* , have been allowed to play the war games they crave,  but in real life this time people get hurt and killed. And cops are cool with that.  trump* seems to get off on it...

WHY?

There are literally HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of police brutality videos the last few days of police against peaceful people protesting against police brutality the last few weeks, being brutalized by police, even sitting down/hands up. Hopefully you haven't seen the woman shot in her face point blank, or the reporter blinded, or the tavern owner killed...  

I wonder in the future the dictionary will define IRONY as : peaceful people gathered to take a stand about police brutality, and the response was a police being more brutal. 
 In other words,  how the fk did trump* and his ilk rise to power??

Something else highlighted recently is that it was originally about cops against blacks, but now it is about cops against everyone. The president even popped in and now citizens and the press are open season .

I've known many police officers in my 64 years, and, sadly most go to work and want to bust skulls.  A few want to serve and protect, but it sucks that that low percent keep silent while the rest overstep the boundaries and cross the line to where THEY should be jailed because they bust skulls.

We are at a point here in the USA where our president is loudly encouraging cops and his military to bust skulls, even on peaceful people sitting down holding signs to protest that cops should not be able to get away with busting skulls, and the cops respond by busting more skulls, WTF?  

He has never done anything to unite us and with his hundred or so ridiculous tweets every day he sets out every day to divide the USA..

Is this the definition of irony?  People are peacefully gathering because police brutality has got to a point where normal people pick up a sign and stand in a crowd to protest police brutality,  BUT the police do more brutality on peaceful people with signs.

As an addendum here, Google evropa, who went online to recruit right wing protesters  like proud boys, Q and other extreme right wing militia groups to pretend to be leftists to riot and press a right wing anti left agenda, even if they killed people to achieve that.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_divisions_of_United_States_Congresses

If you look at the trends, democrats have controlled the country for incredibly long periods of time. Now the user above I think may have conflated a few ideas, because you are half right. In 1995 began a stretch of Republican control in both congress and the senate for 12 years. Prior to that, Congress was majority Democrat since the 30's except for a couple two year periods. Since the mid 90's it have bounced back and forth a bit, though it was majority Republican for most of it.

So the idea that democrats have perpetually been in control is not that far off. But the user I think conflates that with some of the states and the democrat control of those states.

If you look at [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party_strength_in_California), just before 1959 the Republicans had control almost exclusively. From 1959, Democrats had pretty much complete control of who they sent to congress and the senate, as well as the California state assembly and senate. There were a few pockets of Republican executives in the state, but they **always** presided over a Democrat controlled legislature.

If you look at [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party_strength_in_New_York) you see a similar pattern, but it was a little less obvious. It turn pretty solidly blue in almost all facets of government in the mid 1970's. There was still a lot of red until the late 90's, then aside from a George Pataki, the only bit of red is in the state senate, which has held on since then, but is waning. And the last term it was blue as well.

Illinois has been about 50/50 since around the 20's, then in 2000 it shifted entirely to blue at the state and federal level. New Jersey, aside from Chris Christie as Governor, has been entirely blue since about 2000. Maryland has been almost completely blue since the mid 1800's. Since the late 90's Washington has gone from about 50/50 to solid blue.

Anyway, our point is that these are all strongholds for Democrats, all of which have many cities in awful shape where the most unrest occurs in our country. When you look at red states, because there are red states with massive cities with unrest, if you look at the actual control in the counties where those big cities reside and the cities themselves, you see a similar pattern of Democrat control. Houston is in the middle of one of the reddest states in the Union right now, but it has had a Democrat mayor since 1982.

Texas is an especially interested case study. Texas as a state almost entirely blue at the state and federal level until you start seeing some major cracks in the early 90's and then in the mid-90's it went hard into red.

Consider this, people are fleeing California and New York, many of whom are going to Texas. So over the past 20-30 years, Blue states have declined to the point that people want to leave, be it for quality of life, living expenses, or just bad governance, and they are choosing to go to a state that became red and stayed red and has gotten stronger since it turned red.",1591015660,6,Republican,0.021,0.93,0.049,0.9381,positive

"None of those messages are perpetuating violence so I don't see what makes them a ""trash"" group. They are trying to address LGBTQ and Feminist issues because they go hand in hand with the difficulties the African American community deals with.

I also wanted to mention that statement you took from the BLM website ""we are self reflexive..."" in which you stated that the message was ""implying that there's a ""cisgender"" conspiracy to destroy gays which is obviously untrue, gay and lesbian people have all the rights any normal heterosexual has"" has no backing. An implication is something that can be inferred from the interaction of a premise and conclusion. In that statement there is absolutely nothing implied to make you say that BLM is implying that there is a conspiracy. They just stated they want to protect Black trans folk from the violence that befalls on them, which statistically is significant. 

And lastly you stated that ""they don't like america and they never will"", honestly I love this country but i can see where their frustration is coming from. It must not be easy to live in a country where their ancestors were brought in chains only to be held down by oppressive policies such as Jim crow once they were ""liberated"". It must not be easy to live in a country that had terrorist groups like the kkk hunt and kill them, and even have that terror group still exist today. It must be hard to live in a country were a prison system was built and designed specifically to oppress and deisenfranchise. It must be hard to live in a country where the War on Drugs intentionally put so many people of color away under heavy sentence for minor crimes. And it must be hard to live in a country where the president defends garbage white supremacists in Charlottesville but then calls the protestors of BLM thugs.

You can't answer. Neither can BLM. Neither can all the white folks who post pleasant sentiments on facebook saying they stand with BLM. They say we need to speak up when racism happens. WE DO. But we also don't call everything racism when it isn't. We have no idea if the Floyd incident was racially motivated whatsoever. So I can't call it racist, but I'll sure as hell call it wrong and I have. I can't lie. I can't look at the statistics and say ""Welp, all of that is racism..."". OJ Simpson got off, Barack Obama became president, white people love and respect many black people and regard them as some of our heroes. WHERE IS THE RACISM?

They say they want more police accountability. Done, we have body cams now. People in m town cried out for a police accountability board. Guess what that is going to do? Nothing. It has no teeth right now, and when it does have teeth, you know what's going to happen? A cop who did nothing wrong is going to be canned because of the perception. That isn't justice.

It seems like everyone WANTS there to be an answer, they express heartfelt stories about their grandparents being shunned for being an interracial couple back in the 50's.

"While I agree that a systemic problem doesn’t exist, those figures do not necessarily hold water. When we look at the population by race (Whites comprise about 60% of the population compared to 14% for Blacks according to the U.S. Census) we can expect whites killed to be four times higher than blacks. This isn’t true because we can assume that there are good apples and bad apples in each race so we must take into consideration police interactions instead of population. If we look at the crime rates for each race (according to the FBI and the DOJ investigation under the Obama Presidency) we can see that the violent crime rate within the black community is about half that of the white community which reflect the Fatal Officer Involved Shootings (FOIS) report that you provided. Ultimately, we have many issues within our society that need addressed in order to prevent the destruction and division that we are seeing with George Floyd’s murder.   

1. We need to realize that all protesters aren’t necessarily rioters and looters. 
2. We need to realize that all cops aren’t bad cops. Instead of blaming the entire police force for the actions of a few bad apples, we need to hold the individuals accountable. 
3. We need to have a solid leadership within this country that is willing to respect the rule of law while also acknowledging sources of marginalization and injustice. 
4. We need to all learn what respect is again. In today’s day and age, it is far too easy to sit behind a keyboard and forget about the human on the other end.
5. We need to stop seeing race, ethnicity, and religion in everything we do. While the horrors of slavery are something that can never be reconciled, we must also remember that the institution was abolished over a 150 years ago. While certainly all people weren’t equal until the 70’s, we must move on and acknowledge that it is the past or history is certain to repeat itself. We must also remember that whites aren’t entirely to blame for the horrors of slavery, blacks willingly sold blacks and Hispanics held slaves in the Caribbean. 
6. We must realize that in saying one race is more important than another simply because there is adversity in one specific nation, at one specific time in history, we are marginalizing all other races and creating racial disparities (the exact thing that is supposedly being fought). ALL LIVES DO MATTER whether your black, brown, white, orange, blue, elderly, unborn, middle aged, a teenager, Catholic, Muslim, Buddhist, straight, gay, bi, etc. 
7. We need law and order. For those arguing that protesters and rioters/looters are not the same, then you must be willing to show the cops this and do just as much to prevent it as they are or you’re just enabling criminals and thereby becoming synonymous with them. Additionally, police need to see the difference between the different entities too and in a lot of cases, I think both sides are starting to see this. Additionally, we need a government that is going to be willing to step in and squash this violence without stepping on our God-given rights.

"I am not intending to promote violence towards the police, when I have this discussion with more left leaning individuals I am very admit that policing is necessary and important. There are very few police officers in the US (about 765,000 on the state and local level) and from what I have heard anecdotally it's actually becoming increasingly difficult to recruit police officers.

I think your observation about aggression towards police in African American culture is probably true but I think it's important to ask why that sense of aggression exists in the first place. Right now the police departments in some of those cities are not making a great case for themselves with some of the belligerence with which they are treating protesters.

On a side note, I actually think that a more crafty Republican president would have found a way to make this a point of tension between the African American community and the unanimous Democratically controlled city governments that have overseen all these instances of police violence and done little about it.

"You contradict yourself every time you refer to protesters or rioters as thugs and call the people who support them pussies. If a thug is measured by how they brutalize innocents then each cop who commits an act of brutality against a peaceful protester is also a thug and the people who support them are pussies by the same measure. Now we’re at a stalemate. 

I never said YOU felt the protests were wrong, but there’s no denying that a vast majority of right wing news outlets and the president are  guilty of branding all the protests as violent when in reality it’s a very very small proportion of the people there that act like that, and in many cases these protests only turn violent after police show up and begin tear gassing and beating protesters.  This was to show that while you call the left hypocritical for protesting for basic human rights (which may be hypocritical, sure), it’s also hypocritical to not recognize that both parties exhibit their fair share of hypocrisy. 

I will cede that the outrage for the death of David Dorne isn’t as publicized as it should be, but he was killed by looters who were taking advantage of the protests and that responsibility doesn’t fall to the peaceful protestors and the right has weaponized his death and black on black crime to deflect from the issue at hand which is nothing less than gross. Black on black crime is a complicated issue that plagues the black community, but the difference is that when a black person kills another black person on video and with several witnesses, they will without a doubt be jailed. If you know a few cases where that didn’t happen, I’d love to know. But there are countless videos and instances of police killing unarmed black people who aren’t resisting arrest and they get paid administrative leave. And to be frank, the issue of black on black crime has very obviously been caused by historic oppression of black communities, the inability to gather generational wealth, and underfunded schools. Dems and republicans share the blame for causing these situations but the people who are really to blame are the ones who look at a community who was denied human rights for over 500 years and expect them to catch up to the rest of America after only ~50 years of little/no support from the government and no federal hate crime laws to enforce their equality.",1591581313,1,Republican,0.239,0.645,0.116,-0.9974,negative

"First and foremost, you can vote for whoever the hell you want, and who you vote for is nobody's business but your own. If people have a problem that you voted for President Trump, they can go cry it out with their therapist. Social media is full of the types of people who think they can tell you who to vote for. Screw them. 

Trump has had his ups and downs. Even before he became president there was a line to dogpile him and prevent him from becoming president. Foreign media groups compared him to Hitler, domestic media groups compared him to Hitler, these groups are all in the pockets of the political Left. Once he became president there was a massive movement to discredit his presidency, pissed lefties crying ""#notmypresident"" on Twitter as they pissed and moaned through all of 2017 and 2018 and 2019, here we are in 2020 and they are still pissing and moaning. 

So about President Trump: 

His policies are very pro-USA. He loves this country, and he does what he thinks is in the best interests of the long-term health of the USA. This includes being tough on China and providing incentives to remove supply chains from the Chinese mainland in the interest of national security and economic prosperity of the United States and our allies. He is very pro-worker and pro-small business, and his policies reflect that. 

His tax cuts were seen by the left as a ""gift for the rich at the expense of the poor"" but that's not true. They claim it's ""trickle down economics"" but there is no such thing as trickle down economics, and trickle down economics is a term made up by the opponents of supply-side economics, the Keynesians. The goal of these tax cuts was to spur domestic investment and to create American jobs. It has shown to work, but we're in the middle of a crisis. Your parents probably appreciated his tax cuts, they would have made life easier for owners of small businesses. 

He talks way too much on Twitter. He's very narcissistic and self-centered. He is very much like we are, he's not one of the political elite. He reads the same news stories we read, and he gets some things wrong. 

The political left has gone insane. 

Joe Biden isn't a leader, he's a dumpster fire. He probably raped Tara Reade, who accused him of raping her. Unlike the dozen or so accusers of Trump who had no corroborating evidence of wrongdoing until conveniently after he decided to run for president, Reade has been telling her story since it happened. Unlike Christine Blasey Ford, who can vaguely remember anything about the night she was supposedly sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh and his friend, Tara Reade had her mother on national television corroborating her story. The people who say ""They believe Tara Reade, but are still voting for Joe Biden"" are insane. 

Joe Biden is part of the reason police brutality exists at the level it does today. He co-authored the 1994 ""tough on crime"" bill, which has done good and bad things. Opponents say it lead to mass incarcerations of black people in the 1990's as it did provide funds to expand correctional facilities and surge hire police officers. These very people who are pissed off and demonstrating outside of the White House think this is all Trump's fault, as they prepare to vote for Joe Biden. 

We're stepping on eggshells on social media because the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, and others are all catering to the PC crowd. Most mainstream media organizations cater to center-left to hard-left readers. You can expect some level of spin to any story about Donald Trump. You can expect front-page opinion editorials comparing Trump to Hitler, calling him fascist, racist, and anything they can get away with to pull voters to the Democrat Party. The media can print almost anything it wants with few repercussions. Worse still, PolitiFact, factcheck dot org, and Snopes are all run by politically biased liberals. 

Vote for who you think will run this country better. It's very fashionable when you're young to vote for the liberal democrats. I voted Democrat when I was your age, before I started college and developed the capacity to think critically. Back then, all of the Democrat policies sounded great. They sounded like they knew how to create good paying jobs and how to get people more money for working them. In reality, Democrat policies are disastrous.

"I and my my family are immigrants. We support Donald Trump for the following reasons:

He has been the only Presidential candidate of the last 30 years to understand that the United States has been like a ship in the ocean with no destination, rudderless and led by dithering, vacillating captains.

He understood that this country unforgivably bled jobs, treasure, and legitimacy to a brutal dictatorship while our leaders not only did nothing, *they contributed to those conditions.*

He understood that enforcing realistic immigration controls is the only way to prevent an eventual civil and political breakdown of the country. 

His leadership, persuasiveness, and business savvy led to the greatest economic expansion since World War II. This *after* a stuttering, simpering 'recovery' of 8 years. 

His foresight in trying to end foreign entanglements in the Middle East and elsewhere, in forcing our allies to either honor their alliances with us or end them instead of preserving them just for appearances is also a big positive.

His support for real racial reform in the country was another big plus for me supporting him. While others talk about civil rights, Donald Trump got it done. Thousands of people have him to thank for their release from Federal prisons from harsh and unjust sentencing guidelines.

Finally, there is the new normal of american politics: the alternative is far worse. Joe Biden is demented. That's not an insult, that's a diagnosis. Joe Biden will be replaced in the first year of being President should he win, and the Democratic Party is planning on installing Kamala Harris as his Vice-President in order to put a radical who couldn't even win 8 percent support in her own party as the President of the United States.

The democratic party today stands for recession, repression, and regression. Their view of the country is one in which individuals are crushed by a mob goaded to and from issues by an elite and fed watered down beer and slim pickings to keep them satiated. It is a party that is base and repugnant for anyone that believes in the principles of ""All men are created Equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.""

The democratic party wants people to believe that the *government* gives you your rights. The truth is that man is blessed with natural rights, such as freedom to speak your mind, to pursue your own happiness, to defend yourself, to be free to live regardless of your color or creed. 

They want you to forget about these natural rights and instead think of the rights of a prisoner. Food, shelter, entertainment, education and medicine. They want you to beg for these rights and in doing so will capture the people of the country in a cycle that will be incapable of being released from without fleeing, fighting or submitting to the system. This is what occurred in the Soviet Union, Communist China, Cuba, Venezuela and everywhere a political elite wished to rule over the many.



There are more reasons but these are the principal ones.

Donald Trump is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, most people who support him realize he is his own worst enemy because he talks or tweets too much, but frankly I'll take a little Trump tweet along with a little Trump *cojones* because he's been the only President to actually care for the working people of this country by securing for them good paying jobs, a strong economy and peace abroad.",1591663300,39,Republican,0.068,0.803,0.129,0.9815,positive

As a first gen legal immigrant from a Muslim majority country, I find his immigration policies personally very good for the country. I abhor illegal immigration. My family waited in line for more than a decade before we were properly vetted and granted permanent residence. We have much to offer this great nation. Why should a person who coincidentally resides next to this country have the option to a faster immigration for no other qualification?

The biggest reason I’m voting for him is because I don’t like what Biden has to offer and his obvious mental decline.

"Donald J Trump has been the only president to have such high wallstreet and s&p numbers of ANY presidents. He has single handedly lifted up blacks and hispanics with the unemployment numbers. See if you can say the same thing for any dem presidents. He has slashed regulations which are good for business. This means more Americans will make more money. A Dem president (cough sleepy joe) will take away guns (which is our 2nd ammendment) and will start to make being a conservative illegal. So yes, he has been a good president. Up there with the likes of Reagan. We will be remembering his legacy for decades to come.

I will be voting for him because this election decides the fate of America, and I will not bow down to the false song of globalism.

"> Trump is the only president we've had since Reagan to be entirely pro-business

Not quite. Unlike most free market Republicans, Trump has imposed more trade protectionism via tariffs on imported goods from our allies (not just China, which is a justified instance). Propping up uncompetitive industries domestically via taxation is inherently anti-free market. I suggest you read Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations for a better understanding of free market capitalism and trade. Trump’s impulsive use of government restrictions on international commerce is much closer to Bernie Sanders in that regard.

He’s also very heavy-handed with levying government intervention against companies he has a personal grudge against (tech companies especially, which are America’s most innovative segment). Another example of Trump’s authoritarian approach to free market capitalism. Again at odds with conservative free market ideals.

Trump’s redemption in the economy is mostly the work of congressional Republicans. The tax cuts, the repeal of big government intervention in certain industries.

> pro-America when it comes to foreign policy

Not even remotely close to Reagan on this one. Trump has actively worked to dismantle the US-led Western power structure which secured our position as a dominant superpower for 80 years. Aside from his tough stance on China (which has been great and much needed) Trump’s foreign policy has been predominantly anti-US and anti-West.

> he's usually right about China

Agreed, this is refreshing. Aside from the tax cuts this is his other major appeal for me.

> Middle East

His track record is mixed here. Killing Soleimani was a big win. Abandoning the Kurds in Syria was a massive mistake. General Mattis was right to oppose such a cowardly move that led to thousands of Christians/Kurdish allies being slaughtered by Assad.

> At his core he is just America first and not a ""globalist"" like Obama and Bush were.

It’s a good slogan, but he’s certainly much less “America first” than Reagan. Trump has undermined American interests abroad and attacked Pax Americana. The “globalist” trope is a fascinating reframing of the [anti-Atlanticist propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#Content) from our adversaries. In this way, Trump is at odds with Reagan foreign policy.

It’s important to remember Trump was not a Republican until he ran for president and although he often aligns with our agenda he isn’t really a conservative himself. The man is a radical departure from Ronald Reagan in several ways. 

There are many instances when Republicans are able to get Trump back on track with policy, but sometimes he goes his own way.",1591677687,1,Republican,0.055,0.85,0.095,0.9327,positive
"...

Sometimes due to seeds planted by their predecessors.

I'm gonna break down the big ones here.

First, Hoover and the Great Depression.  I know a lot about this one, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is because Hoover was a prolific author and wrote more than any other president we've ever had. 

The short version is that the Great Depression was an inevitable consequence of the Great War and Woodrow Wilson's decision to join it.  To fund the war, he created the IRS and the Federal Reserve, which created new risks in the market.  But more importantly, our involvement in the war allowed France and Britain to be vindictive at the negotiating table.  The result was that Germany wound up owing the US a lot of money that it used to pay Britain and France.  America went into recession, banks hounded Germany to pay up, they couldn't, recession got way worse, Germany got way worse, etc.  

Hoover inherited a system that was primed for disaster.

On to Nixon.  Nixon inherited two things from Johnson's administration.  The first was a brewing situation with OPEC due to the Yom Kippur war.  The second was Johnson's expansion of social entitlement programs.  Both of these were liabilities, but what really hurt Nixon was appointing Arthur Burns to the Federal Reserve.  Burns did not have the fortitude for the job, which requires a person willing to tell the president no sometimes.  It wasn't in Nixon's nature to appoint someone he couldn't manipulate. 

Carter gave the job to Paul Volcker.  Was better for the job, but his method of fixing the monetary problems, combined with Reagan's military spending, lead to serious interest increases that hit consumers and particularly farms.  Where Nixon's crisis was inflation and caused mostly by him picking a weak Fed, Reagan's big recession was driven by lending prices due to Carter leaving him a very tough Fed.  

At the very end of his administration, Reagan appointed Greenspan.  Now, Greenspan was hailed as a genius and served through Bush the elder, Clinton, and Bush the lesser.  Bush the elder and Greenspan hatched on the idea of ""ownership society"", which resulted in massive increases in home prices.  

However, Bush was a neocon and was challenged by Ross Perot (who was kind of a proto-Trump).  Perot got a massive percentage of the vote, giving the election to Clinton.  Without Perot, Bush would have won and taken credit for the first half of the 90's economic miracle.  

But it wasn't a miracle.  Greenspan was creating MULTIPLE massive asset bubbles, the housing bubble and the internet bubble.  Clinton shares blame because he thought it was good too.

The internet bubble was guaranteed to hit whoever won in 2000.  Valuations had gone too high.  

And the housing bubble was guaranteed to hit as soon as boomers slowed down buying houses.",1591678881,3,Republican,0.142,0.748,0.11,-0.9618,negative

"So I've heard the claim that anything good economically is from Obama and Trump is just stealing credit for it. If that's the case then why do numerous Democrats grudgingly admit he's been good for the economy? It's been three years and change. If Trump was bad for the economy then he would have crashed it by now but it took a pandemic to even put a speed bump in the road for it. Now, last week when we were supposed to see a loss of 9 million more jobs we actually gained three million. Was that three million job gain Obama's doing too? I doubt it. I've also heard numerous Democrats openly hope for a recession so that Trump won't look good on the economy and lose in November. That's some pretty sick thinking to want people's lives destroyed just so you can win an election.

Now for the pandemic. The claim that he didn't respond in time has already been debunked by the Associated Press, who are no lovers of Trump by any means. He reacted quickly and shut down travel from China while Democrats were urging people to attend parades in NYCs Chinatown. Your party called him racist for that. The only reason it didn't work is because the virus had already been around for a while at that point and China was hiding the information on it (see link below, one of many stories indicating it was around earlier than reported). Once we knew it was going strong here, what was the Democrats response? House sick people in nursing homes so that thousands of elderly people died.

As far as Trump being the one to sew the seeds of distrust causing 11 days of protest, that's also a very dubious claim at best. I recall President Obama falsely accusing a white police officer of racial profiling just after taking office (Henry Gates case), defending Trayvon Martin who we now know beyond a shadow of a doubt had actually assaulted George Zimmerman (not that Zimmerman was acting smart in that situation but we do know for a fact that he was walking away from the situation and never mentioned Trayvon's race until asked by the dispatcher), and then shook his finger at Dallas PD officers while lecturing them on how they needed to do better after a BLM activist murdered four of their own. I recall watching that particular little gem of his and wondering how on earth he could have the gall to stand there at a police funeral and lecture the police that it was their fault they got murdered by someone in a group he supported. So no, I'm sorry, but race relations were bad back then too. Trump has created more minority opportunity in the country than Obama did so as far as I'm concerned he's done plenty of good there.

And while on the topic of division, Trump has also reversed many of Obama's antisemitic policies. He's acknowledged Jerusalem belongs to Israel and moved the embassy there. He's stopped the policy of appeasement toward Iran. He's stood up to antisemitism in the UN. All of that is the mirror opposite of what Obama did. Meanwhile your party puts antisemites like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib front and center of your policies.
