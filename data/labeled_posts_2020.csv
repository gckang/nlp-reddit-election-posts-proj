Demetri Kofinas speaks with Matt Stoller, Director of Research at the American Economic Liberties Project and author of Goliath: The Hundred Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy. In this nearly two-hour long conversation, we discuss how monopoly, commercial concentration, and regulatory capture drive outcomes in our economy, markets, and political system and what we can do to take that power back.

This episode was recorded on Friday, May 29th, amidst the riots that have been unfolding across the country in response to the death of George Floyd, a 46-year old African American man who appears to have been suffocated by Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin. Neither Matt or Demetri are in any position to provide further insight into what is transpiring in Minneapolis, but they do discuss the response by some members of the media, the White House, as well as the President’s statement that he is going to issue an executive order to roll back Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act with its legal protections for social media companies.",1591043208,0,democrats,,"Matt Stoller: “Right now, I think you have a conflict in the Democratic Party.

" In no particular order:  
\-7 Trump associates found guilty, 1 awaiting trial (until DOJ dropped the case thanks to Barr), 13 Russian nationals charged, 12 Russian military intelligence officers charged in the Meuller trial. A successful Witch hunt it seems.  
\-2018, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood announces that Trump has agreed to shut down his personal charity, the Trump Foundation, after an investigation revealed what she called a “shocking pattern of illegality” involving “unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more.""  
\-Trump declares a national emergency for the purpose of building a border wall. ""I didn’t need to do this,"" he tells reporters that same day, about something that is supposed to be an emergency. ""I just want to get it done faster.""  
\- He hired his daughter and son in law instead of actual qualified individuals. They are real estate heirs that now have senior West Wing positions.   
\- Trump instructed White House chief of staff John Kelly to grant son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance, despite objections from administration officials. Kushner, a senior advisor to the president, maintains close personal relationships with influential members of foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Around this time, Trump does the same for Ivanka.  
\- As it turns out, Ivanka Trump sent hundreds of emails from a private account shared with her husband Jared Kushner to government officials. Same thing they attacked Clinton for.  
\- He used federal agents (some from prison departments, who are not trained to interact with civilians) to attack and disperse peaceful protests in Lafayette Park. He then took a picture with a bible.  
\- State Department uses Trump hotels during travel. Essentially tax money going to his hotels. Example: Vancouver B.C. $15,000 (2017).  
\- He fires people that whistleblow or try to stop his illegal activities. Attorney General was fired for pointing out that the Muslim Ban was unlawful.   
\- He told police no to be so nice and have so much restraint when arresting people.  
\- COVID-19: Lied about tests. Did nothing with the extra months. White house got really bad contracts with defunct companies his buddies owned to pay 5x prices for masks. Said we should use bleach and UV light in the body.  
\- Called countries shithole countries.  
\- Has issued pardons only to his white-collar friends. unlike other presidents that use pardons for injustice against petty criminals. (Flynn) Then he corroded the values of the DOJ by silencing professionals in the organization when they did not like that he just freed Flynn.  
\- Tried to bribe Ukraine into investigated Biden (impeached for this). then refused to allow any witnesses. In a phone call with recently-elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asks his counterpart to open an investigation into the family of former vice president Joe Biden, and into a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s alleged involvement in interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This occurred days after Trump ordered staffers to freeze more than $391 million in congressionally-appropriated military aid to Ukraine.  
\- Clumsily drew over hurricane path map after wrongfully claiming on twitter that Alabama will be hit hard. He instructs National Weather Service not to contradict (correct) him.  
\- FCC repealed net neutrality, he selected Ajit Pajit I believe.

\- Pulled out of Paris Accords.  
\- Ignorantly wants to remove USPS. Even though USPS is profitable but is only held back by old backward rules.

\- Removed guidance from Obama that required public schools to allow transgender people from choosing their bathrooms.  
\- Defunded any international organization that promotes abortions.  
\- He repealed DOD policy (from Obama) so transgender people cannot openly serve.  
\- His tax bill makes corporate tax cuts permanent and individual tax cuts are only temporary.  
\- Kept open Guantanamo Bay. Kep prisoners that were supposed to be released from being released.  
\- Keep claiming immigrants are the cause of crime. They have very low crime rates.  
\- Most of his associates have been indicted for their role in the Russian intervention of our voting system. He literally is the swamp.  
\- Secretary of Environmental Protection is a formal coal lobbyist. Secretary hosted fundraising events for senators that were part of his consideration.   
\- Removed limit to use scientific research.  
\- Climate change denier.  
\- Made detaining immigrants a lucrative business for private prisons that fund his campaigns: $35 per day per inmate is the normal rate for prisons, ICE pays $300. Private prisons moved their annual conference to Trump National Doral golf resort. substandard medical care, deaths, suicides, sexual abuse, and exploitative labor practices, the Obama Justice Department had announced a phaseout of the private sector’s role in the federal prison system.  
\- He has played more golf and taken more vacations than any president recently. Yes, he made fun of Obama for golfing.  
\- Housing Urban development department. Ben Carson is not fit for the position, by his own words. Opportunity Zone program given to areas that were previously described as too rich to receive it.  
\- Said vote by mail leads to fraud. This is fake news.  
\- DOJ. Instead of being the nation's chief law enforcement officer, Barr acts like the president's defense lawyer. Barr wrote and released a deceptive ""summary"" of the Meuller report. Barr is the head of the White House's noncooperation policy with congress. Barr overruled prosecutors who sentenced Roger Stone for lying to congress.  
\- Prosecution of white-collar crimes, (price fixin', tax fraud, and environmental offenses) fallen to the lowest level in decades.  
\- Whenever corporate leaders and foreign government officials want to carry favor with trump they just stay at his DC hotel. Like how T mobile and Sprint spend 195K at the hotel while the government considered their merger deal.  
\- Munchin, head of department of finance, was supposed to divest his interest in a company due to conflict of interest...so he sold the shares to his fiance (now wife). He tried to use government jet for his honeymoon but was stopped by lawyers.  
\- Forgave taxes so companies can bring money back into the US, but those companies just used it for stock buybacks. He should have put a clause for that.   
\- Trump never disclosed his tax returns, something every president has done. He also did not put his wealth into a blind trust to prevent conflicts of interest, like other presidents have done. He is able to withdraw money at any time from the trust he made and he is provided with regular updates about the companies by his son.  
\- Current Department of Health and Human Services head was a current pharma lobbyist and president of Eli Elly (while there insulin tripled in price).  Policies that push low income families away from Medicaid. Systematic destruction of Affordable Care act by deleting links and references from government websites.  
\- Department of Transportation, wife of McConnell and owner of an international shipping business. Cut subsidies to cargo ships that compete with her family business. Gave 2.3M grant to her husband's home state local transit authority. She did not divest in a road construction company until she was ousted by Wall Street Journal.  
\- Obama created transparency by publishing daily visitor logs to the White House, Trump announced he will not do that.  
\- His executive order to investigate voter fraud was a total failure. Trump claimed 5 million fraudulent ballots, the investigation found only 4 (4 not 4 million).  
\- Tried to fire Meuller for investigating him...Subject of an investigation trying to fire the one in charge of investigating him. This fire attempt is grounds for another justice obstructing act.  
\- Don Jr accepted meeting with Russia in exchange for dirt on Clinton.  
\- Trump pardons Sheriff Arpaio, who was convicted with criminal contempt for not following order to stop racial profiling by cops.  
\- US secret service pays Trump International Gold Club 61K to rent golf carts during his trips there. Tax payer money of course.   
\- Most of the tax cuts he did were for the rich. Don't take my word for it, he said ""you all just got a lot richer"" to his guests are Mar a lago after he signed the Tax Cuts act.  
\- Trump continues to use his personal cell phone (the same guy who accused Clinton for using private servers for emails.)  
\- Paid 130K to prostitute to keep her silence about having sex with him.  
\- Trump intervenes to put a stop to the FBI’s long-planned relocation to the D.C. suburbs, pushing instead for a more costly proposal in which a new FBI headquarters would be constructed on the same plot of land—which just happens to be a short distance from a Trump Hotel. With the FBI staying put, hotel competitors can’t move in.  
\-Love for country but not for subpoenas: Barr refused to comply to subpoenas for Meuller Report AND for census question debacle. Mnuchin does not comply with the congressional subpoena for Trump tax returns. McGahn ordered not to comply with a subpoena for his testimony. Annie Donaldson does the same.  
\-Air force personnel stay at Trump hotel in Scotland. Tax payer money to Trump once again.  
\-Without warning, the administration announces its intent to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, effectively clearing the way for the Turkish military to attack American-allied Kurdish forces in the area. The president, who admitted in 2015 that the Trump Tower development in Istanbul meant he had a “little conflict of interest” when it comes to Turkey, reportedly issues the directive at the request of Turkish strongman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. A National Security Council staffer tells Newsweek that Trump got “rolled” during their call.  
\-The president announces plans to host the 2020 G-7 summit of world leaders at Doral, a Florida golf course that—you’ll never believe this—he owns.   
\-Forty-seven state officials, including 20 Republican governors, have made 64 visits to Trump properties, sometimes resulting in state taxpayer funds being spent there.   
\-The president has visited his properties 362 times at taxpayer expense during his administration, sometimes visiting more than one of them in a single day. In 2019 alone, he has visited his properties 81 times, helping to further establish them as centers of political power.  
\- One-hundred eleven officials from 65 foreign governments, including 57 foreign countries, have made 137 visits to a Trump property",1591685495,8,democrats,,"After being overwhelmed the Trump's failures and corruption, I decided it would help me to keep track of them.","After being overwhelmed the Trump's failures and corruption, I decided it would help me to keep track of them.  In no particular order:  
\-7 Trump associates found guilty, 1 awaiting trial (until DOJ dropped the case thanks to Barr), 13 Russian nationals charged, 12 Russian military intelligence officers charged in the Meuller trial. A successful Witch hunt it seems.  
\-2018, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood announces that Trump has agreed to shut down his personal charity, the Trump Foundation, after an investigation revealed what she called a “shocking pattern of illegality” involving “unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more.""  
\-Trump declares a national emergency for the purpose of building a border wall. ""I didn’t need to do this,"" he tells reporters that same day, about something that is supposed to be an emergency. ""I just want to get it done faster.""  
\- He hired his daughter and son in law instead of actual qualified individuals. They are real estate heirs that now have senior West Wing positions.   
\- Trump instructed White House chief of staff John Kelly to grant son-in-law Jared Kushner a top-secret security clearance, despite objections from administration officials. Kushner, a senior advisor to the president, maintains close personal relationships with influential members of foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Around this time, Trump does the same for Ivanka.  
\- As it turns out, Ivanka Trump sent hundreds of emails from a private account shared with her husband Jared Kushner to government officials. Same thing they attacked Clinton for.  
\- He used federal agents (some from prison departments, who are not trained to interact with civilians) to attack and disperse peaceful protests in Lafayette Park. He then took a picture with a bible.  
\- State Department uses Trump hotels during travel. Essentially tax money going to his hotels. Example: Vancouver B.C. $15,000 (2017).  
\- He fires people that whistleblow or try to stop his illegal activities. Attorney General was fired for pointing out that the Muslim Ban was unlawful.   
\- He told police no to be so nice and have so much restraint when arresting people.  
\- COVID-19: Lied about tests. Did nothing with the extra months. White house got really bad contracts with defunct companies his buddies owned to pay 5x prices for masks. Said we should use bleach and UV light in the body.  
\- Called countries shithole countries.  
\- Has issued pardons only to his white-collar friends. unlike other presidents that use pardons for injustice against petty criminals. (Flynn) Then he corroded the values of the DOJ by silencing professionals in the organization when they did not like that he just freed Flynn.  
\- Tried to bribe Ukraine into investigated Biden (impeached for this). then refused to allow any witnesses. In a phone call with recently-elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump asks his counterpart to open an investigation into the family of former vice president Joe Biden, and into a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine’s alleged involvement in interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This occurred days after Trump ordered staffers to freeze more than $391 million in congressionally-appropriated military aid to Ukraine.  
\- Clumsily drew over hurricane path map after wrongfully claiming on twitter that Alabama will be hit hard. He instructs National Weather Service not to contradict (correct) him.

"Hello all!

I am a Canadian, although I find I have been following US Politics ever since Trump became President. 

I never really stayed up to date on US political news before this, but I find that every day is just revelation after revelation, argument after argument. 

My question is, what were the news cycles like during the Obama Administration? The Bush Administration? Before?

Has the news just ramped up their focus on the presidency, or has it always been this....intense? Did the sides switch in the Obama Administration, where FOX was trying to shine a light on the Presidents missteps with facts, and CNN/MSNBC blindly defending him? Same question with the Bush Administration?

Just wanted to know what it was like back then, and if what we are witnessing now especially and in these past four years is anything special, or (if Biden wins this year) we can just expect more books, more bombshell interviews, more secret sources speaking out etc etc.

**Rex Tillerson: Former Secretary of State**

Mike Pompeo is doing a great job, I am very proud of him. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, didn’t have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldn’t get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell. Now it is a whole new ballgame, great spirit at State!

Hundreds of millions of dollars donated are not even going to black communities to help in any way, shape, or form! Over 300 MILLION DOLLARS alone went towards “Bernie for President” and Biden’s campaign...none of that went to help black communities AT ALL!

Senators Oath

Oath of Office. Upon taking office, senators-elect must swear or affirm that they will ""support and defend the Constitution.""

What oath must state and federal officials take?

“The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a ...

Governors Oath

I (Governor) do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of 
_________ against all enemies foreign and domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of ________

Do mayors take an oath of office?

When persons elected to office take the oath, they swear or affirm that they will faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of the office to the best of their ability.

If a public officer is convicted of violating the oath in Georgia, the punishment will be a prison term between one and five years. They will be guilty of a felony.

Some oaths of office are a statement of loyalty to a constitution or other legal text or to a person or other office-holder (e.g., an oath to support the constitution of the state, or of loyalty to the President).

So thats why PresidentTrump said the states need to Govern themselves ""by the oath they took when they took office""

What is the President's oath when taking office?

""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the ""United States"" , and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

No where in that oath does it say he has to babysit the elected officials for each state. 

So these elected officials need to stop blaming President Trump for the failures of the oath they swore to uphold..
