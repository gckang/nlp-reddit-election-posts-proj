If it wasn't, the alternative almost certainly wasn't to maintain a 6 foot bubble, it would have been to stay at home.\n\nI'm not suggesting in any way that Joe didn't want to hang with these guys and take a picture with them.  He loves that kind of stuff.  He has a 40-plus year reputation in politics of being a guy who loves to get with the masses and shake some hands, slap some backs, and kiss some babies, hear their stories, and emphasize with their problems  He knew all the regulars on his train route home to Delaware each day during his years in the Senate by name and knew a lot of their families and other details about their lives just from chatting with him.\n\nHonestly, I think he has probably really been having trouble being essentially confined to his home during this pandemic for that reason.  He felt a responsibility to provide a good example and be seen listening to and following the advice of the scientists and the doctors, though.  That was where he needed to be at that moment in history.\n\nHistory is moving at lightning speed, however, and the protest was where he needed to be today.  He brought his mask, but strict social distancing in that sort of situation is tough for anyone, and impossible if you're running for President of the United States.\n\nI feel you, though. I wouldn't be out there in any sort of mass gathering right now.  I get nervous about the possibility of accidentally coming closer than six feet to someone while walking my dog, or the minimal contact I need to make to pick up essential supplies (From my car).\n\nJoe Biden is a brave guy, and has a special vocation right now.\n\nI remember reading some inside stuff about recent Popes and they know their physical security precautions against individuals who mean them harm is not sufficient from a security point of view.  One Pope got tackled by some random person with a grudge as he was proceeding into Christmas Eve Mass during the opening hymn two years in a row.  That could have easily been much worse.  But they feel their vocations require them to take the risk.\n\nNow, when and if he becomes President, there is going to be a different calculus surrounding Biden's decisions, and I think if something like this happened during his administration and it coincided with a pandemic, he'd probably be addressing the nation from the Oval Office and meeting with key protesters and police figures at the White House, where they would be tested for the virus, have their tempetures taken prior to entry, and have infrared cameras monitoring their body heat.\n\nA challenger for the Presidency who is his party's presumptive nominee doesn't have the ability to or the luxury of taking those precautions at a big moment like this, though.  It's a tough position to be in, balancing the need to model good health concious behavior for the nation and the need to show support for the African-American community during an important time, but we should be glad he is willing to make the tough choices and hope he gets through the campaign without contracting the virus.  He won't do stupid things like Trump probably will be before the end of this and holding rallies in front of thousands of tens of thousands of people, but there will be moments where he is going to still have to be certain places and interact with the public in smaller groups like this. I don't envy him.\n\nThe times and Biden's age certainly argue for a Vice-Presidential running-mate like Elizabeth Warren who could step in and be ready to be President on day 1 if called upon.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1590995791, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {"gid_1": 1}, "id": "fsi6srv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gucmeh", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_fshtt0i", "permalink": "/r/democrats/comments/gucmeh/joe_biden_talks_with_and_takes_pictures_with/fsi6srv/", "quarantined": false, "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1596935296, "score": 29, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "democrats", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn70", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/democrats", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 1, "treatment_tags": [], "name": "t1_fsi6srv", "ups": 29}

[1] In May, the Michigan Care Improvement Registry found a drastic decrease in vaccination rates among children across nearly every age group. The percentage of children five months and younger who remain up-to-date on recommended vaccines declined from 67.9 percent in 2019, to 49.7 percent in May 2020.[2] The New York City health department reported a 63 percent drop in the number of vaccine doses administered to children between March 23 and May 9, including a 91 percent drop for children ages 2 and above.[3]\n\nThe administration of routine pediatric immunizations remains critical throughout the duration of this public health emergency. The decline in immunizations is largely attributable to efforts by families to adhere to social distancing guidelines to reduce both their exposure to, and the spread of COVID-19. But if this trend of decreased immunization rates among children continues, the United States could face yet another public health crisis: increased risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Such outbreaks would put lives at risk, and place additional stress on our health care system and public health infrastructure at a time when these systems are struggling to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTo avoid this potential crisis, we urge the CDC to immediately develop an action plan that incorporates targeted public outreach and education efforts on addressing vaccine hesitancy and emphasizing the importance of pediatric immunizations; resources for communities that have seen reductions in their immunization rates since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; and guidance for parents and families on how to safely access pediatric immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic, including best practices regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) use and other precautions to limit the risk of exposure to COVID-19 in health care settings; and necessary efforts to ensure rapid catch-up for children who are not up to date on critical pediatric vaccines.\n\nIn addition to developing the plans described above, we request that you respond to the following questions no later than July 1, 2020 to help us better understand how the federal government is working to address the alarming drop in pediatric immunization rates: \n\n\n1.   What specific steps is CDC taking to reverse the dramatic drop in vaccinations since mid-March? \n\n\na.   How does CDC plan to capture accurate real-time data on pediatric immunization rates and identify potential solutions, particularly in vulnerable communities? \n\n\n2.   What outreach and education efforts are underway at CDC to address fears among parents and families related to bringing children into health care settings during the COVID-19 crisis? \n\n\na.   Is CDC planning a public information campaign to address vaccine hesitancy, and if so, how will CDC ensure that the necessary communication on the importance of routine immunizations is reaching parents and families?\n\n\nb.   How will CDC ensure that families receive guidance on safe access to care for children during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the appropriate use of PPE? \n\n\nc.    How will CDC communicate with health care workers, and provide the necessary tools to inform communities about the importance of receiving pediatric immunizations during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n\nd     What guidance is CDC providing to pediatricians and other health care workers on procedures to ensure that they can safely provide and promote routine pediatric immunizations?\n\n\ne.    Given the significant increase in unemployment due to COVID-19, many families are finding themselves uninsured. How will CDC raise awareness of the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program to ensure that families know their children can still access routine immunizations, and how does CDC plan to support participating VFC providers as they work to catch up VFC-eligible children on missed vaccinations, while also preparing for the upcoming flu season?\n\n\n3.   How will CDC monitor the ongoing availability and ordering of pediatric immunizations, including doses and other essential medical devices, PPE, and other supplies needed to store, transport and administer vaccines, and what plans are in place to address any supply chain disruptions? \n\n\na.   Is CDC taking steps now to ensure that the availability of pediatric immunizations, and necessary medical devices and supplies, is not impacted when production and domestic distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine is underway?\n\n\n4.   Has CDC developed or reviewed modeling or projections that predict the potential impact on future vaccine-preventable outbreaks if the current pediatric immunization rate continues throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic? \n\n\n5.   Does CDC require additional resources from Congress in order to support efforts to reverse the decline in pediatric immunizations? If so, what level of funding would be sufficient? \n\n\nWe appreciate your timely response and look forward to working with you on this critical issue.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1591074007, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fslsbv1", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_gv0vls", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_gv0vls", "permalink": "/r/democrats/comments/gv0vls/van_hollen_hassen_raise_concerns_over_declining/fslsbv1/", "quarantined": false, "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1597001674, "score": 1, "send_replies": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "democrats", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qn70", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/democrats", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "name": "t1_fslsbv1", "ups": 1}

They think this is a war game and plainclothes people are the 'supposed' enemy and they will get the most points at any cost to put down innocent people, just because they are on the other side and in front of you!  \n\nPolice now, under trump* , have been allowed to play the war games they crave,  but in real life this time people get hurt and killed. And cops are cool with that.  trump* seems to get off on it...\n\nWHY?\n\nThere are literally HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of police brutality videos the last few days of police against peaceful people protesting against police brutality the last few weeks, being brutalized by police, even sitting down/hands up. Hopefully you haven't seen the woman shot in her face point blank, or the reporter blinded, or the tavern owner killed...  \n\nI wonder in the future the dictionary will define IRONY as : peaceful people gathered to take a stand about police brutality, and the response was a police being more brutal. \n In other words,  how the fk did trump* and his ilk rise to power??\n\nSomething else highlighted recently is that it was originally about cops against blacks, but now it is about cops against everyone. The president even popped in and now citizens and the press are open season .\n\nI've known many police officers in my 64 years, and, sadly most go to work and want to bust skulls.  A few want to serve and protect, but it sucks that that low percent keep silent while the rest overstep the boundaries and cross the line to where THEY should be jailed because they bust skulls.\n\nWe are at a point here in the USA where our president is loudly encouraging cops and his military to bust skulls, even on peaceful people sitting down holding signs to protest that cops should not be able to get away with busting skulls, and the cops respond by busting more skulls, WTF?  \n\nHe has never done anything to unite us and with his hundred or so ridiculous tweets every day he sets out every day to divide the USA..\n\nIs this the definition of irony?  People are peacefully gathering because police brutality has got to a point where normal people pick up a sign and stand in a crowd to protest police brutality,  BUT the police do more brutality on peaceful people with signs.\n\nAs an addendum here, Google evropa, who went online to recruit right wing protesters  like proud boys, Q and other extreme right wing militia groups to pretend to be leftists to riot and press a right wing anti left agenda, even if they killed people to achieve that.
