"A U.S. federal court of appeals panel suspended a venture capital firm’s grant program for Black women business owners, ruling that a conservative group is likely to prevail in its lawsuit claiming that the program is discriminatory.

The ruling against the Atlanta-based Fearless Fund is another victory for conservative groups waging a sprawling legal battle against corporate diversity programs that have targeted dozens of companies and government institutions. The case against the Fearless Fund by was brought last year by the American American Alliance for Equal Rights, a group led by Edward Blum, the conservative activist behind the Supreme Court case that ended affirmative action in college admissions.

The appeals court panel, consisting of two judges appointed by former President Donald Trump and one appointed by President Barack Obama, rejected the Fearless Fund’s arguments that the grants are not contracts but charitable donations protected the First Amendment right to free speech.

The campaign, the first of several the group plans to make in the current cycle as part of a goal to spend $60 million, is the latest announced in recent weeks for state legislative races by Democratic and nonpartisan groups, whose spending will far exceed $100 million during the 2024 election.

It also further underscores the growing attention on contests for state House and Senate, where policies on issues like reproductive rights and voting rights can often have a more direct impact on people’s lives.

"President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a major new policy initiative shielding tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants residing in the United States from deportation, in what amounts to one of the most sweeping immigration measures of his tenure in office.

Under the initiative, the Department of Homeland Security will take action to effectively grant federal protections to some undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens. The new program, known as “parole in place,” will affect an estimated 500,000 spouses of U.S. citizens and 50,000 children under the age of 21, administration officials said. It’s the same immigration policy that has been used for qualifying military families since 2007.

In addition, Biden will also announce a policy that makes DACA recipients and Dreamers eligible for work visas, rather than temporary work authorization.

"President Biden on Tuesday announced an initiative that could be life-changing for hundreds of thousands of undocumented young adults, known as Dreamers, whose ability to live and work in the United States has long been tied to a temporary immigration program that has been on life support.

The new directive will enable many beneficiaries of an Obama-era program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, to swiftly receive employer-sponsored work visas for the first time. Eventually, the young immigrants could apply through their employers for green cards, or permanent lawful residency.

The new policy is one of two new immigration measures the administration announced on Tuesday. It means that a generation of young people who entered the country illegally as children will no longer be dependent on whether the DACA program, implemented as a temporary fix in 2012 and ensnared ever since in complex litigation, survives or dies.

The White House has now directed federal agencies to streamline the process for undocumented college graduates to obtain official work visas, a process that was largely unattainable for most of them up until now because they were living unlawfully in the country.

"President Joe Biden announced a new immigration policy that could allow DACA recipients greater access to H-1B visas and other employment paths. The change would streamline existing authorities and aid other undocumented immigrants ineligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. President Obama created the program in 2012 to protect young people without legal status brought to the United States by their parents. A September 2023 District court ruling in Texas declared DACA unlawful for new participants but allowed it to continue for current recipients. With no action by Congress, advocates have pushed for more administrative protections for DACA recipients and others.

The second policy will direct the State Department and Department of Homeland Security to enable DACA recipients and others without legal status to gain an H-1B or other employment-based temporary visas. DACA is not a legal status but a form of executive branch protection from deportation. (A White House background press call provided additional information on both policies.)

“The parole in place provisions for undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens will get more press attention, but the other administrative action may be just as important,” said Cornell Law School professor Stephen Yale-Loehr, an advisor to the National Foundation for American Policy. “Employers have been reluctant to use the D-3 waiver because the process was slow and unclear. New State Department guidance is expected to make D-3 waivers more predictable and faster. In this tight labor market, that will be great news for employers.”

A DACA recipient who obtains a D-3 waiver and H-1B status might become eligible for permanent residence via employer sponsorship.

"Federal judges in Kansas and Missouri on Monday together blocked much of a Biden administration student loan repayment plan that provides a faster path to cancellation and lower monthly payments for millions of borrowers.

The judges’ rulings prevent the U.S. Department of Education from helping many of the intended borrowers ease their loan repayment burdens going forward under a rule set to go into effect July 1. The decisions do not cancel assistance already provided to borrowers.

In Kansas, U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree ruled in a lawsuit filed by the state’s attorney general, Kris Kobach, on behalf of his state and 10 others. In his ruling, Crabtree allowed parts of the program that allow students who borrowed $12,000 or less to have the rest of their loans forgiven if they make 10 years’ worth of payments, instead of the standard 25.

But Crabtree said that the Department of Education won’t be allowed to implement parts of the program meant to help students who had larger loans and could have their monthly payments lowered and their required payment period reduced from 25 years to 20 years.

In Missouri, U.S. District Judge John Ross’ order applies to different parts of the program than Crabtree’s. His order says that the U.S. Department of Education cannot forgive loan balances going forward. He said the department still could lower monthly payments.

Together, the two rulings, each by a judge appointed by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, appeared to greatly limit the scope of the Biden administration’s efforts to help borrowers after the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected the Democratic president’s first attempt at a forgiveness plan. Both judges said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona exceeded the authority granted by Congress in laws dealing with students loans.",1719289189,11,democrats,:snoo: Article ,"Missouri, Kansas judges temporarily halt much of President Biden's student debt forgiveness plan","Missouri, Kansas judges temporarily halt much of President Biden's student debt forgiveness plan Federal judges in Kansas and Missouri on Monday together blocked much of a Biden administration student loan repayment plan that provides a faster path to cancellation and lower monthly payments for millions of borrowers.

### Legal Charges Against Trump

#### ""Trumped up"" Charges and Lack of Merit

**1. Hush Money Case in New York City:**

**Federal Election Commission (FEC) Findings:**
- The FEC reviewed the nondisclosure agreement related to the alleged hush money payments and did not find any violations of federal election laws. This determination suggests that there was no illegal activity regarding campaign finance.

**Credibility of Witness:**
- Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and the key witness for the prosecution, has been disbarred and has a documented history of lying, which raises questions about the reliability of his testimony.

**2. Jan. 6 Case:**

**Trump’s Call for Peaceful Protest:**
- During his speech on January 6, Trump explicitly said, “Let’s go up to the Capitol and protest peacefully and patriotically.” This statement indicates that Trump did not incite violence but instead called for a lawful demonstration.

**3. Georgia Election Case:**

**Legal Interpretation of Trump’s Statement:**
- In a phone call with Georgia officials, Trump expressed concerns about election fraud and said, “I need to find 11,000 votes.” Legal experts argue that this statement can be interpreted as a request to identify legal votes rather than an attempt to fabricate new ones. This interpretation suggests that Trump was seeking a legitimate recount or verification process.

**4. Classified Documents Case:**

**Declassification and Security Measures:**
- Trump claimed to have declassified the documents in question before leaving office and stored them securely at Mar-a-Lago. Declassification authority lies with the President, and securing the documents in a locked room indicates an effort to protect sensitive information.

**Comparison with Biden’s Document Handling:**
- President Biden was found to have mishandled classified documents, some of which dated back to his time as Vice President. Despite this, Biden has not faced similar legal action, highlighting a potential inconsistency in how these cases are treated.

**5. New York Real Estate Case:**

**Financial Impact on Banks:**
- Trump repaid all loans associated with the real estate transactions in question, and the banks involved reportedly did not suffer any financial losses; instead, they made profits. This lack of financial harm to any party questions the necessity of legal action, as there is no clear victim.

### Political Motivation and Public Perception

**Claim of Political Motivation:**
- There is a widespread belief among Trump’s supporters that the legal actions against him are politically motivated, aiming to hinder his 2024 presidential campaign. This perception is bolstered by the timing and nature of the charges, which many see as attempts to undermine his candidacy.

**Public Reaction:**
- Polls and public opinion indicate that a significant portion of the American electorate views the legal challenges against Trump as unfair and politically driven. This belief could influence voter behavior, potentially increasing support for Trump in the 2024 election.

### Today's Polling Statistics from FiveThirtyEight (June 2024)

According to FiveThirtyEight, Trump is performing as follows in the latest polls:
- In head-to-head matchups against President Biden, Trump is consistently within a few percentage points, indicating a highly competitive race.
- Among Republican primary voters, Trump maintains a substantial lead over other potential candidates, with support hovering around 50% or higher in most polls.

These statistics reflect Trump's strong position within his party and a competitive stance in the general election, despite the legal challenges he faces.",1718374653,0,Republican,,Elevator Speech Supporting Trump and Replying to politically motivated allegations.,"Elevator Speech Supporting Trump and Replying to politically motivated allegations.

They made this accusation whenever anyone disagreed with their plans or the current narrative, and every time Trump's name was mentioned.  Democrat politicians say it, the media repeats it, and ""Intelligence Officials"" reinforce it.

In 1974, not long after Joe Biden entered the Senate, he was on television in a town hall type setting, answering questions.

Remember that in 2014, Robert Gates, Obama's Secretary of Defense said of Biden ""I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades”

Biden has a long history of making racist statements and policy positions.

In 2018, Biden went on national TV and bragged about getting a prosecutor in Ukraine, who was looking into the theft of $2 billion in US aid, fired - by threatening to withhold $1 billion more in US aid.  Not mentioned was that the person who committed the theft had hired Hunter Biden for a no-show job he wasn't qualified for, at $1 million per year.

In 2020, Politico reported that Obama said ""Don't underestimate Joe's ability to f*** things up.""

Further, by the time 2020 rolled around, it was clear to any unbiased observer that Biden was beginning to have cognitive issues.

Nearly half of the state governors are Democrats, some of them quite popular.  In addition to the governors, there were many members of Congress, mayors, and people who were no longer in office but could have run.

...but the DNC, the movers and shakers in Washinton DC, and the media all solidified behind Biden as their chosen candidate, even to the extent of cheating against Bernie in the primaries (again).

Why pick someone who our Intelligence officials knew was corrupt, and everyone else should have *suspected* was corrupt, who had a history of incompetence and racism, and who now had cognitive issues that everyone who had close contact with him for any extended period could not miss?

Intelligence Officials knew he was corrupt.  They'd been covering for him for years, burying investigations and evidence.  All the decades he was stealing classified documents from the Senate, they knew.  Democrat officials knew he was incompetent, as Gates and Obama both said.  He made it clear to everyone he was stupid, by publicly outing his own corruption from 1974 to the present.  ...and everyone who had any sort of extended contact with him from 2020 on - from administration officials, to journalists, to foreign dignitaries, could see he was having cognitive issues.

Remember that the DNC and media have spent the last 4 years **lying** to us about Biden's cognitive issues, and continued to do it until it could no longer be denied.  Some few are still doing it.  Every time he did or said something that made it clear he was having difficulty operating at a basic level, the usual suspects made excuses instead of doing their duty to the country, to the American public, and **to Democrat voters**.

Biden should never have been chosen as the candidate in 2020, but people can fool themselves up to a point to avoid having to face unpleasant reality.  ...but we're now at a point where Biden's deterioration has been obvious for years.

Instead of admitting this and taking steps to address it, the DNC, government officials, Democrat Congressional leaders, and the media have all done their best to hide and excuse it - calling anyone who dared to say the Emperor had no clothes every name they could think of.

What could be a greater threat to 'Our Democracy' than having a President in office who was corrupt, stupid, and incompetent **before** his dementia became too advanced for him to function reliably?

...but not satisfied with endangering the country by keeping Biden in office for his first term, the people propping Biden up decided to run him for re-election in 2024.  ...and not only did they decide to run him for 2024, they did their best to ensure that Biden had no significant opposition in the Democratic Primaries - thus robbing **Democrat voters** of the opportunity to choose a better Democratic candidate.  This wasn't an accident.

So now, there are finally calls to replace Biden as the 2024 nominee.  ...now that Democrat voters no longer have a voice in who that might be.
