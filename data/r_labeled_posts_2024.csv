"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says he’ll make sure Donald Trump can vote in his home state this November despite his felony convictions.

DeSantis said Friday that he disputes the assessment of some experts who say that Trump’s conviction on 34 felony counts would make him ineligible to cast a ballot in the state.

But, in any case, the Florida governor said he would ensure the state clemency board cleared the way for his former rival for the Republican presidential nomination to vote back home.

"The Filibuster is a tool that requires 60 votes in the Senate to pass legislation. It is easily exploited by the Minority Party.

"A U.S. federal court of appeals panel suspended a venture capital firm’s grant program for Black women business owners, ruling that a conservative group is likely to prevail in its lawsuit claiming that the program is discriminatory.

The ruling against the Atlanta-based Fearless Fund is another victory for conservative groups waging a sprawling legal battle against corporate diversity programs that have targeted dozens of companies and government institutions. The case against the Fearless Fund by was brought last year by the American American Alliance for Equal Rights, a group led by Edward Blum, the conservative activist behind the Supreme Court case that ended affirmative action in college admissions.

The appeals court panel, consisting of two judges appointed by former President Donald Trump and one appointed by President Barack Obama, rejected the Fearless Fund’s arguments that the grants are not contracts but charitable donations protected the First Amendment right to free speech.

I promise you it will sting them harder than any nuisanced argument you can provide.

It's their innate feeling that Trump could cure cancer and world hunger and the left would still say he's the worst president ever and only did those things because they somehow line his pockets etc.

""Gun Derangement Syndrome"" hits them right back at the core and opens their eyes a lot more to their blind obsession with guns being good ""no matter what happens"". It takes the wind out of their sails a LOT on the which is the unhinged political side.  Especially with younger conservatives or even independents that see the hypocrisy of always being pro gun no matter how many innocents die and not allowing any nuisance in to a middle ground.


This is a political talking point that Democrats could win with a lot more from independents and young conservatives to vote their way that are really bothered about shootings and not NRA religious nuts.

The old school conservatives types won't budge no matter what you say but young conservatives and independents will be swayed by arguments that call out the old school conservative emotional obsession with limitless gun rights.

"President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a major new policy initiative shielding tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants residing in the United States from deportation, in what amounts to one of the most sweeping immigration measures of his tenure in office.

Under the initiative, the Department of Homeland Security will take action to effectively grant federal protections to some undocumented spouses and children of U.S. citizens. The new program, known as “parole in place,” will affect an estimated 500,000 spouses of U.S. citizens and 50,000 children under the age of 21, administration officials said. It’s the same immigration policy that has been used for qualifying military families since 2007.

In addition, Biden will also announce a policy that makes DACA recipients and Dreamers eligible for work visas, rather than temporary work authorization. This will apply to DACA recipients, Dreamers and others who have earned a college degree or higher in the U.S. or who have received a job offer from a U.S. employer related to their degree.

"President Biden on Tuesday announced an initiative that could be life-changing for hundreds of thousands of undocumented young adults, known as Dreamers, whose ability to live and work in the United States has long been tied to a temporary immigration program that has been on life support.

The new directive will enable many beneficiaries of an Obama-era program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, to swiftly receive employer-sponsored work visas for the first time. Eventually, the young immigrants could apply through their employers for green cards, or permanent lawful residency.

The new policy is one of two new immigration measures the administration announced on Tuesday. It means that a generation of young people who entered the country illegally as children will no longer be dependent on whether the DACA program, implemented as a temporary fix in 2012 and ensnared ever since in complex litigation, survives or dies.

The White House has now directed federal agencies to streamline the process for undocumented college graduates to obtain official work visas, a process that was largely unattainable for most of them up until now because they were living unlawfully in the country.

"President Joe Biden announced a new immigration policy that could allow DACA recipients greater access to H-1B visas and other employment paths. The change would streamline existing authorities and aid other undocumented immigrants ineligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. President Obama created the program in 2012 to protect young people without legal status brought to the United States by their parents. A September 2023 District court ruling in Texas declared DACA unlawful for new participants but allowed it to continue for current recipients. With no action by Congress, advocates have pushed for more administrative protections for DACA recipients and others.

The second policy will direct the State Department and Department of Homeland Security to enable DACA recipients and others without legal status to gain an H-1B or other employment-based temporary visas. DACA is not a legal status but a form of executive branch protection from deportation. (A White House background press call provided additional information on both policies.)

“The parole in place provisions for undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens will get more press attention, but the other administrative action may be just as important,” said Cornell Law School professor Stephen Yale-Loehr, an advisor to the National Foundation for American Policy. “Employers have been reluctant to use the D-3 waiver because the process was slow and unclear. New State Department guidance is expected to make D-3 waivers more predictable and faster. In this tight labor market, that will be great news for employers.”

A DACA recipient who obtains a D-3 waiver and H-1B status might become eligible for permanent residence via employer sponsorship.

"Federal judges in Kansas and Missouri on Monday together blocked much of a Biden administration student loan repayment plan that provides a faster path to cancellation and lower monthly payments for millions of borrowers.

The judges’ rulings prevent the U.S. Department of Education from helping many of the intended borrowers ease their loan repayment burdens going forward under a rule set to go into effect July 1. The decisions do not cancel assistance already provided to borrowers.

In Kansas, U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree ruled in a lawsuit filed by the state’s attorney general, Kris Kobach, on behalf of his state and 10 others. In his ruling, Crabtree allowed parts of the program that allow students who borrowed $12,000 or less to have the rest of their loans forgiven if they make 10 years’ worth of payments, instead of the standard 25.

But Crabtree said that the Department of Education won’t be allowed to implement parts of the program meant to help students who had larger loans and could have their monthly payments lowered and their required payment period reduced from 25 years to 20 years.

In Missouri, U.S. District Judge John Ross’ order applies to different parts of the program than Crabtree’s. His order says that the U.S. Department of Education cannot forgive loan balances going forward. He said the department still could lower monthly payments.

Together, the two rulings, each by a judge appointed by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, appeared to greatly limit the scope of the Biden administration’s efforts to help borrowers after the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected the Democratic president’s first attempt at a forgiveness plan. Both judges said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona exceeded the authority granted by Congress in laws dealing with students loans.",1719289189,11,democrats,:snoo: Article ,"Missouri, Kansas judges temporarily halt much of President Biden's student debt forgiveness plan","Missouri, Kansas judges temporarily halt much of President Biden's student debt forgiveness plan Federal judges in Kansas and Missouri on Monday together blocked much of a Biden administration student loan repayment plan that provides a faster path to cancellation and lower monthly payments for millions of borrowers.

"The Supreme Court has handed down a ruling flat in the face of the founding fathers, the federalist papers, the anti federalists, and the very purpose and definition of the executive as created by the constitution. Not a king, a president is liable for criminal misconduct after leaving office, even if that conduct or violation of the Constitution was a so-called “official act.” In fact the senate, while having the power to convict and remove a president, has no power to impose other penalties. That responsibility was specifically left to the normal procedures of the Law. Leaving criminal prosecutions and accountability to the same institutions and processes as every citizen.

It is stated and defined clearly that a president is liable for criminal prosecutions and charges, just like every other citizen. No person especially a president should be immune from criminal accountability. Those who serve must be held to the highest standard of the law to protect the public tranquility and Liberty. The Founding Fathers intended for the President to be subject to both impeachment and criminal prosecution for abuses of power and crimes committed while in office. This understanding is in direct contrast to President Trump’s claim of immunity from criminal prosecution for acts committed while in office. It is a direct contradiction of the courts ruling.

This ruling creates a blank check for any crime. A president can commit any crime while in office, using the precedent of “Official Act” and have zero liability whatsoever.

 May I remind you my fellow citizens, it was not long ago that the court also ruled in the citizens United case, dismantling the Tillman act of 1907 which banned corporate contributions in our election process. 

This court has overturned

•	⁠40 years of environmental precedent
•	⁠50 years of Abortion protection precedent
•	⁠60 years of Affirmative Action precedent
•	⁠and now, 248 years of limited POTUS power precedent

The despots on the court have a history of corruption unimaginably dangerous and fateful to the nation. My fellow citizens, it is time to consider what kind of country we now have. We may have a king after all. Right now that King is Biden. What will he do?

Dissent to the ruling. 
 Sotomayor wrote. “In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law. This majority’s project will have disastrous consequences for the Presidency and for our democracy.”

Jackson echoed her warning: “If the structural consequences of today’s paradigm shift mark a step in the wrong direction, then the practical consequences are a five-alarm fire that threatens to consume democratic self-governance and the normal operations of our Government.”

Sotomayor wrote, “The long-term consequences of today’s decision are stark. The Court effectively creates a law-free zone around the President, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the Founding.”
 
Jefferson. 

“If [as the Federalists say] “the judiciary is the last resort in relation to the other departments of the government,” … , then indeed is our Constitution a complete felo de so. … The Constitution, on this hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they may please. It should be remembered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics, that whatever power in any government is independent, is absolute also; in theory only, at first, while the spirit of the people is up, but in practice, as fast as that relaxes. Independence can be trusted nowhere but with the people in mass. They are inherently independent of all but moral law …”

 “You seem to consider the judges the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions; a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges … and their power [are] the more dangerous as they are in office for life, and are not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves … . When the legislative or executive functionaries act unconstitutionally, they are responsible to the people in their elective capacity. The exemption of the judges from that is quite dangerous enough. I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society, but the people themselves.”

 May I remind you my fellow citizens, it was not long ago that the court also ruled in the citizens United case, dismantling the Tillman act of 1907 which banned corporate contributions in our election process. 

This court has overturned

•	⁠40 years of environmental precedent
•	⁠50 years of Abortion protection precedent
•	⁠60 years of Affirmative Action precedent
•	⁠and now, 248 years of limited POTUS power precedent

The despots on the court have a history of corruption unimaginably dangerous and fateful to the nation. My fellow citizens, it is time to consider what kind of country we now have. We may have a king after all. Right now that King is Biden. What will he do?

Dissent to the ruling. 
 Sotomayor wrote. “In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law. This majority’s project will have disastrous consequences for the Presidency and for our democracy.”

Jackson echoed her warning: “If the structural consequences of today’s paradigm shift mark a step in the wrong direction, then the practical consequences are a five-alarm fire that threatens to consume democratic self-governance and the normal operations of our Government.”

Sotomayor wrote, “The long-term consequences of today’s decision are stark. The Court effectively creates a law-free zone around the President, upsetting the status quo that has existed since the Founding.”
 
Jefferson. 

“If [as the Federalists say] “the judiciary is the last resort in relation to the other departments of the government,” … , then indeed is our Constitution a complete felo de so. … The Constitution, on this hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they may please. It should be remembered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics, that whatever power in any government is independent, is absolute also; in theory only, at first, while the spirit of the people is up, but in practice, as fast as that relaxes. Independence can be trusted nowhere but with the people in mass. They are inherently independent of all but moral law …”

 “You seem to consider the judges the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions; a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. Our judges … and their power [are] the more dangerous as they are in office for life, and are not responsible, as the other functionaries are, to the elective control. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal, knowing that to whatever hands confided, with the corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots. It has more wisely made all the departments co-equal and co-sovereign within themselves … . When the legislative or executive functionaries act unconstitutionally, they are responsible to the people in their elective capacity. The exemption of the judges from that is quite dangerous enough. I know of no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society, but the people themselves.” 

“there is no danger I apprehend so much as the consolidation of our government by the noiseless, and therefore unalarming, instrumentality of the Supreme Court.”",0.088,0.843,0.069,-0.9112,negative

**Letter to the Editor: Exposing the Media's Complicity in Shielding Trump and His Allies' Violent Rhetoric**

Dear Editor,

I am writing to confront your publication’s alarming negligence in reporting the dangerous rhetoric and threats of violence perpetuated by former President Donald Trump and his supporters. By selectively omitting these critical issues, you are effectively acting as an arm of the Trump campaign, shielding him and his allies from accountability. Why are you hiding from your readers that:

1. **Donald Trump retruthed a call for ""treason tribunals"" on Truth Social, accompanied by a picture of Liz Cheney, implicitly endorsing political violence**. Such acts of amplifying extremist views are not just concerning but dangerous, yet your coverage remains insufficient (sources: Reuters, Independent). Specifically, Trump called for media outlets like NBC News and MSNBC to be investigated for ""Country Threatening Treason"" (source: www.allsides.com).

2. **Nick Fuentes publicly called for the execution of ""perfidious Jews,"" atheists, and homosexuals**. This direct incitement to violence against these communities should be headline news, but your readers are left in the dark about these dangerous declarations (sources: The Jerusalem Post, Angry White Men). Fuentes stated at a rally, ""We're in a holy war...we will make them die"" and called for the death penalty for non-Christians (sources: www.jpost.com, www.angrywhitemen.org).

3. **A CPAC speaker declared onstage, ""We’re going to end democracy and replace it with this,"" while holding up a fist**. This blatant call to undemocratic actions represents a significant threat to our democratic values, yet it receives minimal coverage in your publication when it shouldn’t have left the front page for a week (source: www.independent.co.uk).

4. **Steve Bannon threatened former FBI officials, saying they should ""grab their passports and run while they can""**. This intimidation from a prominent figure is deeply alarming, and your downplayed reporting on this issue is unacceptable (source: www.independent.co.uk).

5. **The pastor of Governor Ron DeSantis has called for the death penalty for homosexuals**. This endorsement of state-sponsored violence against a marginalized group is chilling and demands more attention than it has received in your publication (source: www.independent.co.uk).

All of this being hidden from view removes the context of the extremist, hand picked, pro trump individuals on the Supreme Court taking action to ensure all these threats could be carried out legally with the stroke of a president’s pen.

By failing to fully report on these incidents, you are complicit in hiding the real and present dangers posed by these individuals and their inflammatory statements. The repeated terrorist threats being made by Trump and his allies are being concealed from voters, and this is the real crime. It is your duty to hold all public figures accountable for their words and actions, especially when they have the potential to incite violence and threaten our democratic institutions.

Your reluctance to expose these threats does a disservice to the community and undermines the very principles of a free press. It is imperative that you address this oversight and commit to providing balanced and thorough coverage of these critical issues. The public deserves to know the full extent of the threats posed by these individuals and the real danger they represent.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Anyways I donated $46 dollars and will most likely again next month and the month after up until we win this thing in November. Felt good, I didn’t give until much later last cycle but I wanted the President to see we’re still out here and we’re still behind him.

In the past few weeks I’ve had several conversation with Republicans I have known for years and some for just a week or two. 

These are the topics that are changing minds:
1. Mass Deportation: Even my MAGA mom doesn’t want to see her Vietnamese hairstylist or her Chinese Oncologist deported. I could make no headway with mom for almost a decade but I have finally broken through and mom brought dad with her.
2. Retirement Benefits: My second cousin is a retired colonel and a major Republican. I showed him how Project 2025 is planning to take away his inflation adjusted benefits. He was understandably pissed.
3. Supreme Court placing the President above the law: At least some of the MAGA really don’t like that because it is clearly unconstitutional even to the 2a worshipers.

Let’s be clear these are all Republicans. A vote away from R and one more vote for D.

Maybe we start talking to our family, friends and acquaintances about what the future holds if Rs win in November?

"Excerpt:


Now that the GOP is trying to portray itself as championing the working class, the platform eschews the party’s traditional embrace of big business. But only for public consumption.


Despite all the populist virtue-signaling from the convention podium, Trump has made clear that his economic policy is for sale to the highest bidder. In a meeting with billionaire campaign donors, he reportedly promised to keep their taxes low by extending those tax cuts, some of which would otherwise expire at the end of next year. In a meeting with oil company executives, Trump asked for $1 billion in campaign donations and promised to reverse President Biden’s environmental policies, including the transition to electric vehicles.

"The National Labor Relations Board issued a final rule today reviving a tactic commonly used by unions to delay votes on dissolving bargaining units or elections they think they will lose.
 
The rule rescinds a measure adopted by appointees of Republican former President Donald Trump in 2020, which the now Democratic-led board said could interfere with the right of employees to make free, informed decisions on union representation.
 
It is the latest move by the Biden-era NLRB seen as favoring unions, after the agency last year adopted rules speeding up the union election process and created a new path for unions to organize workers outside of the longstanding secret-ballot election process.
 
The 2020 rule that the board wiped out today had barred NLRB staff from temporarily blocking elections while a related case alleging illegal labor practices was being litigated.

"I'm 40 years old this year, and while I've been politically ""involved"" for 22 years - showing up to vote, keeping tabs on politics, educating myself - I've been on the bench my whole life.  Very very rarely donated, and never volunteered.  

But everything is starting to change.  As an LGBT man growing up in the South, it was so invigorating seeing us making serious progress over the years.  If you aren't old enough to remember, a LOT of us were around for the days when being LGBT was literally illegal in over half of the county - it was 2003 when that changed.  And that's just one of the major injustices I've seen overthrown in my lifetime, and I'm only 40 years old.

Now, the left is feeling beaten down.  Eight years of Trump fatigue and the supreme court has been rough.  But the fact of the matter is this - this election is do or die.  The Republicans do not intend to EVER lose power again if they win this time around.  They literally - among other things - want to eliminate thousands of federal employees and replace them with Trump loyalists.  That's not opinion, that's not my take, that's what they wrote down on paper and proudly showed the world.  They plan to get rid of the department of education - again, not my opinion, it's literally what they said. 

So where am I going with this?  Get involved.  We need to get involved NOW.  There are SO many ways to volunteer, and thousands have signed up, but we still have a LOT of work to do.  Republicans are registering more new voters in several swing states than we are, left leaning voters are more likely to stay home and not show up, young voters especially, and turnout is always the left's biggest weak spot.

So I'm volunteering this year, for the first time in any election ever.  And I'm trying to create a ripple effect of bringing people with me.  Can I get three people - just three people out of all of Reddit - to commit to:

- volunteering with me in some way shape or form
- passing it on, seeking three friends to volunteer as well? 

There are SO many ways to volunteer, even if you're not in a state that's up for grabs, and helping the presidential ticket also pretty much always helps down ballot and state level candidates (house, Senate, State Congress, governor, etc.)  You can call and text individuals in swing states, you can help try to get people to sign up to vote (they target blue areas, don't worry), you can just reach out to people and give them a nudge that helps increase the odds of them showing up, you can do tech work!

The best thing about volunteering?  It's not a job, you don't even have to put in a two week notice if you hate it and want to quit!  :)

At least 70 pro-Trump conspiracists are election officials in key battleground counties — and they are poised to make a giant mess on Election Day

When election night comes in November, it will be up to thousands of local election officials to certify election results in their counties. Among those election officials are scores of Donald Trump supporters who believe his lies and conspiracies about stolen elections — and will be in prime position to act on those beliefs to try to aid his campaign in November.

In the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, Rolling Stone and American Doom identified at least 70 pro-Trump election conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results. At least 22 of these county election officials have refused or delayed certification in recent years.

Certification of election results is what legal experts consider a “ministerial task,” and one required by state and local law. But as Trump’s lies about the 2020 election have taken hold, Republicans nationwide have decided that certification provides them an opportunity to hear fraud allegations — and refuse to officially count their local votes. Republicans have refused to certify election results at least 25 times since Trump lost the 2020 election to President Joe Biden. 

“I think we are going to see mass refusals to certify the election” in November, says Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias. “Everything we are seeing about this election is that the other side is more organized, more ruthless, and more prepared.” (Continued in article)",1722287963,14,democrats,:snoo: Article ,These Swing State Election Officials Are Pro-Trump Election Deniers,"These Swing State Election Officials Are Pro-Trump Election Deniers Paywall Bypass:

"For a quarter of a millennium, America's brave veterans have fought valiantly abroad and, occasionally, at home, to protect the hallowed principles upon which America was founded-equality of all people, the right of all to blaze their own path, and perhaps greatest of all, the right to vote for our leaders. They have fought in foreign lands, and come back scarred, and sometimes, in a coffin, asking for little in return other than this--that we dare not to take for granted the liberties we experience in this great nation.

The preservation of liberty can only be achieved through action, and we owe it to those countless brave men and women who risked and gave their lives for our liberty to take action now. There are, at this moment, forces within our nation who seek to take our most sacred right, our right to vote, away from us.

The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 is a direct attack on everything veterans have ever fought for--it turns the President into a king. Project 2025, among other things, calls to give the sitting President complete control over the Department of Justice, the FBI, the CIA, the Federal Election Commission, the FCC, among dozens more administrations. What does this accomplish? It allows the President to terminate and replace ANY administrative employee, for ANY reason, with ANYONE. It puts one person in direct control of who (and who doesn't) get federally investigated, in control of appointing election workers as those who enforce elections laws, in control of what news broadcasting stations maintain their licenses, etcetera.

The Supreme Court has already proven itself a willing participant in this decimating of our separation-of-powers, making the entirely unConstitutional ruling that a President has legal immunity for any and all ""official actions"" taken while in office, making it literally and utterly impossible to try a President for taking bribes, using the military against civilians, for pardoning partners in crime, and thousands of other actions--laying the groundwork for the otherwise unConstitutional implementation of Project 2025.

While Biden is in Washington, trying to pass legislation to take these powers away from the President, away from himself, and trying to reform the Supreme Court to prevent the dissolution of our Constitution, Trump is on the campaign trail, claiming not to know anything about Project 2025 (although half it was written by his cabinet, and he said in April 2022, of the Heritage Foundation, ""This is a great group, and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do and what your movement will do when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.”); while his Vice President pick wrote the foreword to the literal book on Project 2025, originally titled ""Dawn's Early Light: Burning down Washington to Save America""; and saying this at a rally at Turning Point Action: ""Get out and vote, just this time! You won't have to do it anymore; four more years, you know what? It'll be fixed, it'll be fine, you won't have to vote anymore... you gotta get out and vote. In four years, you won't have to vote anymore."", a direct promise to take away the representation of millions of voters, representation that hundreds of thousands of American soldiers have died for.

Only one thing is certain--while you may not agree with some, or any, of Harris' platform, a vote for Trump is a vote to destroy the oldest surviving democracy in the world--the United States of America. It is a vote to create a tyrannt, in a nation birthed out of a war to rid itself of a tyrannt.

The rise of the tyrannts American soldiers have risen again and again to defeat--the likes of Hitler, Mussolini, Kim Il Sung, amd indirectly, Stalin--all mirror each other. Each rose to power by sowing distrust among their peoples, distrust in the media, distrust in the news, distrust in schools, distrust in historians, distrust in professionals, distrust in fellow citizens, and positing themselves as the only person able to guide them out of the dark place they find themselves in. What American today, MAGA or otherwise, could argue that this hasn't been Donald Trump's prime political tactic since the beginning? And what supporter of MAGA doesn't believe Donald Trump is the sole answer to America's trust crisis?

George Orwell warns us in his famous 1984: ""The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, mos essential command."" Let us then make our judgement without respect to any party, but with our own eyes, ears, and minds: Donald Trump is a tyrannt in the making.

"The Democratic-led Senate will hold a key test vote Thursday on a bipartisan bill to expand the child tax credit and provide some tax breaks for businesses.

But it’s not clear Democrats have enough Republican support to break a filibuster and advance the bill toward a final vote, as many GOP senators oppose it.

The vote on the bill, which would provide the most financial help to multi-child households, comes as Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee, faces heated criticism over past remarks disparaging “childless cat ladies” and questioning the character of women who choose not to have kids. Vance is scheduled to visit the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona on Thursday and is expected to miss the vote. His office didn’t say how he'd vote if he were in Washington.

Democrats are casting the vote as a response to Vance, with Schumer saying Wednesday that most Republicans will vote against it even as they “say they care about families."" It will be the last vote the Senate casts before it leaves Washington for the August recess until Sept. 9. The House passed the child tax credit bill in January.

There is substantial Senate GOP opposition to the bill, led by Mike Crapo of Idaho, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, who is aligned with party leadership.

"Stacking the Court is a request that's been floated around by the Internet for a while now, and has picking up steam with every horrible decision they've been making over the last few years. The popular suggestion is that there must be 13 justices—one for each circuit court of appeals. But, to do so, the President needs some actual choices all lined up and ready to go.

So, I think now's the right time to talk about it: if you could nominate four people to the Court, who would you want?

Keep in mind: legally, **you can pick anyone.** They can be completely biased picks. They don't even need a law degree or any experience in law. That said, presidents prefer to choose people with actual legal experience, as they're expected to be the most effective at the job.

To get the ball rolling, I did a little digging of my own, and came up with these picks:

-Legalized same-sex marriage in Oregon

-Mentors inexperienced lawyers to foster an effective and thriving judicial system

-Blocked a nationwide Trump-era law that would have worsened overall healthcare quality, especially for lower-income citizens

[https://ballotpedia.org/Michael_McShane](https://ballotpedia.org/Michael_McShane)

**Kathy Seeley**

-Ruled in favor of a group of young environmentalists, dismissing a provision that restricted Montana agencies from factoring in harmful emissions and environmental impact for energy project permits

[https://ballotpedia.org/Kathy_Seeley](https://ballotpedia.org/Kathy_Seeley)

**Maya Guerra Gamble**

-Protected private citizens seeking abortion in Texas from being sued by anti-abortionists

-Oversaw the Alex Jones Sandy Hook case, where she ordered him to pay millions for endangering parents of victim(s)

Keep in mind: legally, **you can pick anyone.** They can be completely biased picks. They don't even need a law degree or any experience in law. That said, presidents prefer to choose people with actual legal experience, as they're expected to be the most effective at the job.

To get the ball rolling, I did a little digging of my own, and came up with these picks:

**Mark E. Walker**

-Long successful history of defending and upholding voting rights in  Florida
 [https://ballotpedia.org/Mark_E._Walker_(Federal_judge)#:~:text=Mark%20Eaton%20Walker%20is%20the,became%20chief%20judge%20in%202018](https://ballotpedia.org/Mark_E._Walker_(Federal_judge)#:~:text=Mark%20Eaton%20Walker%20is%20the,became%20chief%20judge%20in%202018)

**Michael J. McShane**

-Legalized same-sex marriage in Oregon

-Mentors inexperienced lawyers to foster an effective and thriving judicial system

-Blocked a nationwide Trump-era law that would have worsened overall healthcare quality, especially for lower-income citizens

[https://ballotpedia.org/Michael_McShane](https://ballotpedia.org/Michael_McShane)

**Kathy Seeley**

-Ruled in favor of a group of young environmentalists, dismissing a provision that restricted Montana agencies from factoring in harmful emissions and environmental impact for energy project permits

[https://ballotpedia.org/Kathy_Seeley](https://ballotpedia.org/Kathy_Seeley)

**Maya Guerra Gamble**

-Protected private citizens seeking abortion in Texas from being sued by anti-abortionists

-Oversaw the Alex Jones Sandy Hook case, where she ordered him to pay millions for endangering parents of victim(s)

[https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2022/12/24/alex-jones-infowars-texas-abortion-cases-judge-maya-guerra-gamble-in-spotlight/69742505007/](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2022/12/24/alex-jones-infowars-texas-abortion-cases-judge-maya-guerra-gamble-in-spotlight/69742505007/)

"President Joe Biden’s mind was elsewhere as he watched the fireworks explode in the sky above the White House on July 4.

Two epic sagas were unfolding behind the scenes. Both would come to help define his presidency. A U.S.-brokered international prisoner exchange was coming together, and his campaign was falling apart.

Privately, Biden and his inner circle were on edge, uncertain exactly where the next few weeks would lead. They calculated that how they handled the month of July was crucial for him politically and personally. And the one thing that might have shown the American public the president was very much engaged in governing was something they couldn’t talk about.

The deal to free Americans from Russian custody was underway well before Biden’s disastrous debate performance on June 27, and U.S. officials stressed that the president’s calculations on the swap were not affected by his considerations of whether to step down.

But the two are connected. The timing of the two precarious negotiations means they are paired together in the memories of many on Biden’s team, perhaps with at least some sense of “we told you so.”

This story is based on interviews with 13 officials, staffers and diplomats, most of whom were granted anonymity to speak freely about the inner workings of the Biden White House.

Disclaimer: I am not advocating to abolish the EC, I am just pointing out its flaws in this post. I don’t love it but I don’t know that there’s a fair alternative at the moment. 

So we all know the electoral college was created for a myriad of reasons, one of them being the concern that uneducated farmers in rural America wouldnt get fair representation. 

Knowing this, there’s this really insane cognitive dissonance within the Republican party. They’re like— “We can’t elect by the popular vote, otherwise there will never be a Republican president!” 

Ummmm. Yeah. Your views are unpopular. So maybe the world isn’t out to get you or get Donald Trump just because. If you feel attacked, it’s because the majority of people in this country disagree with you. 

Also on the flip side of this, a Republican hasn’t won the popular vote in what, 20 years? Why should the educated majority of a country be ran by a President that was elected by the uneducated minority?  

I don’t have an alternative to the EC, because I dont believe that uneducated people shouldn’t get representation just because they are uneducated. But it makes you wonder if Republicans can put two and two together. Between 

1.) Highly educated people (PhDs) typically voting Democrat in the North where education is ranked highest, and
 
2.) Poorly educated people typically voting Republican in the South where education is ranked lowest…

Do they ever sit back and wonder that not only is the belief of their party morally questionable, but that their party actually IS the lesser party (as in thats a fact and not an opinion) and that’s why it’s wildly unpopular amongst the more intelligent population? 

Sadly unintelligent people aren’t really capable of that level of introspection so they will continue to be taken advantage of while the rest of us have to 
 abide by the rules of a President elected by the uneducated minority. ",1722636227,37,democrats,article,There’s something funny about Republicans and the Electoral College,"There’s something funny about Republicans and the Electoral College

"For Arizona Democrats, this election is about more than delivering Kamala Harris a key Sun Belt state. It is a test of the party’s down-ballot strength as Democrats mount their most aggressive campaign yet to flip the state Legislature.

Taking control of Phoenix has emerged as the top target nationwide for Democrats focused on rebuilding state power after more than a decade of GOP dominance in state capitals.

After years of failed attempts, Democrats believe they finally have the right ingredients to capture complete statewide control for the first time since the 1960s: record-breaking fundraising, boosted candidate recruitment and the emergence of abortion as an election-defining issue.

And the fight is tight. Democrats just need to pick up one seat in both the House and Senate to tie with Republicans, and two to claim majorities.

Their messaging is straightforward: Republicans are crazy and have driven Arizona to a desperate place. It reflects a broader national strategy as Democrats settle on their approach for beating former President Donald Trump — and taking back power within the states.

Taking control of Phoenix has emerged as the top target nationwide for Democrats focused on rebuilding state power after more than a decade of GOP dominance in state capitals.

After years of failed attempts, Democrats believe they finally have the right ingredients to capture complete statewide control for the first time since the 1960s: record-breaking fundraising, boosted candidate recruitment and the emergence of abortion as an election-defining issue.

And the fight is tight. Democrats just need to pick up one seat in both the House and Senate to tie with Republicans, and two to claim majorities.

Their messaging is straightforward: Republicans are crazy and have driven Arizona to a desperate place. It reflects a broader national strategy as Democrats settle on their approach for beating former President Donald Trump — and taking back power within the states.

"8 Weird things about tRump 2nd edition

1) After Joe Biden worked with Germany and other countries to broker the release of 16 prisoners unjustly held, tRump congratulates Vladimir Putin for putting together a great deal at an Atlanta rally on 3 August. Weird and un-American. 

2) tRump backed out of Sept. 10 debate on ABC, rescheduled for Sept. 4 on Fox News, then immediately accused Kamala of backing out of the debate that she just learned about and hadn't agreed to.  Weirdo.

3) tRump lusts after his own daughter. He commented on her breasts and backside to his chief of staff John Kelly and has made public comments about dating her. That's not just weird, it's creepy. 

4) tRump makes the White House a family affair.  I can't think of another US president who filled so many posts with family members. They are not the royal family because we don't have kings in the USA.  Weird.

5) Not considering tRump's current legal woes, he and his businesses have been involved in more than 4000 legal cases in state and federal courts since 1970. Cases have included real estate disputes, contract payment disputes, personal defamation and over 100 tax disputes.  That's not normal. It's weird.

6) Republicans for Harris is picking up steam with many prominent Republicans endorsing Harris. Some of them worked in the tRump administration.  And folks like the previous VP, Mrs. J Kemp, and prior cabinet members have chosen not to endorse this weirdo.  That is because tRump doesn't reflect their values.  tRump is not normal. 

7) Let's take a moment to look at the irony of ""Truth""  Social. It exists because tRump couldn't stop lying on a pre-Elon Twitter after he lost the election.  During his 4 years in office tRump told 30k+ verified lies. On average, 21 per day, everyday.  This eclipses any other politician by a (Trump voice) HUGE (End Trump voice) margin. Yet, tRump is still the GOP candidate.  Weird.

8) tRump is not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed.  Here a a recent rambling rant from the orange one: “Google, nobody called from Google. One of the things like doing a show like yours, your show, you know, you see it on Fox, but when you really see it is all over the place, they take clips of your show that you're doing right now with me and if I do a good job, they're gonna vote for me, they're gonna vote for me because it's not just on Fox, it's on Fox is a smaller part of it.

"Vice President Kamala Harris has rapidly consolidated the support of the nation’s most powerful labor unions, adding critical organizing muscle to her campaign as she tries to limit former President Donald Trump’s inroads with the working-class voters who could swing the election.

Since taking over the top of the ticket, Harris has stressed to top labor leaders that she plans to stick with the staunchly pro-union agenda that President Joe Biden instituted, leaning on the administration’s record to secure the backing of a movement that’s enjoyed its closest relationship with the White House in decades.

It’s a near-universal alliance of major labor organizations — save the Teamsters and firefighters union — that Biden carefully cultivated throughout his extensive political career and punctuated with a promise to be the most labor-friendly president in history. Now, it’s Harris who’s counting on the payoff, betting that the unions can still deliver their members in droves across battlegrounds like Michigan and Pennsylvania.

The early moves underscore the expansive political power that the labor movement has accumulated within the Democratic Party, even as it prepares to move beyond Biden. And it reflects a belief within the Harris campaign that top union leaders wield the influence needed to turn out working-class voters — and halt the drift toward Trump among a growing slice of their rank and file.

"I'll admit that I voted for Trump in 2016, because while I didn't really like him *or* Hillary, I felt at the time that he was the better choice. But now? The Republican party has all but become a Trump *cult*. Even the evangelicals who support him do so in a way that seems as though they worship *him* instead of Him. He's clearly not a good person, refuses to accept any accountability for his actions or even acknowledge the serious trouble that this country is in. At least not beyond the caricatures he paints of the people who oppose him.

And then there was Biden. Clearly in cognitive decline and for some reason hell-bent on acting like everything was fine. When he introduced Zelensky as Putin, I think part of me *actually* died. Because it wasn't just a one-off gaffe or a Freudian slip. This man is clearly confused, and he's our representative on an international stage when we stand *dangerously* close to large scale global conflict. Trump might be an immoral idiot, but at least he's in control of his faculties.

Then along comes Harris, and while I wasn't totally sold on her, choosing Walz as her VP absolutely sealed the deal. I firmly believe that this man represents my hope for a better future in this country. He doesn't have a spotless past, and God knows Trump and his devotees will hound him for it, but he represents what Christianity is *truly* about. Forgiveness, redemption, and above all, LOVE. Not the mindless obedience and idolization that Trump's Christian following displays.

I'm sorry to ramble here, and I don't necessarily expect anyone to read all of this or care, but among other things, being gay has started becoming scary again after Clarence Thomas came out and stated that the Supreme Court should reconsider past rulings on homosexuality, sodomy etc. And while my vote may honestly be cast for Walz more than Harris, I say fuck it. There's absolutely no good reason why we can't have a woman president, and she's at least far better than the alternatives.

"Hi, I'm from the Philippines, but I always keep an eye on political developments in the United States. It's nice to see that Democrats are energized and highly engaged with Kamala Harris. I also see some similarities between what's happening in the Harris campaign and the 2022 presidential campaign of former Philippine Vice President Leni Robredo.

First, big rallies. During the elections here in the Philippines, large rallies were a significant factor, particularly for Robredo. Even though she was only second in the surveys, these large rallies gave her hope that she could defeat the now-President of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos Jr.

Robredo's final campaign rally, held in the financial capital of the Philippines, drew close to one million attendees.

Now, I see that crowd size is a big deal in the elections there in America as well.

But large rallies alone are not enough for a candidate to win. What happened was that it was mostly us, the supporters who were already convinced to vote for our candidate, who attended these rallies. Yes, we could boast about the size of our rallies, but it wasn't enough to turn the tide. There were still many undecideds, and our opponent was still strong.

Perhaps, instead of focusing on the size of the rallies, the Harris campaign should emphasize going house to house to convince people to vote for her. Just imagine if the tens of thousands attending Harris's rallies all went door to door to persuade others—I believe she would be a sure winner.

Here in the Philippines, we started the house-to-house campaign late. Yes, it was effective, but we ran out of time to gain ground.

Second, disinformation. I'm also active on Twitter/X and can see how severe disinformation is in America. Our candidate admitted that ignoring fake news did not help address it. It needs to be tackled head-on. It would be great if legal action could be taken against those spreading fake news, like what Dominion and Smartmatic did to Fox News. Hit them where it hurts.

I'm not an American, but I hope Harris wins. She's really the only one who can save the reputation of the U.S. in the eyes of the world. She visited the Philippines last 2022, and we have a lot of trust in you, especially since you're helping us counter China's aggression.

"I know this is gonna be a bit of a let down, but I think Democrats are surprisingly blind to how bad the campaign in actually going, and I see the same mistakes and attitude from 2016 happening. Have we forgotten how off-guard 2016 took us? I remember not even staying up that night to watch election results. I went to bed and throught to myself tomorrow we will see the first female president, because at the time, of course we would. We now know how completely wrong that was.

So first off, I think we need to dispel this whole notion that Kamala is surging in the polls while Trump is failing. The truth is many aggregates are throwing out polls for being too “partisan,” but they’re actually only throwing out polls that are favorable to the right. The Trump campaign and FOX news as well as other right leaning sources are able to produce their own aggregates of polls that show Trump way ahead of Kamala. Being that you have such a range of results when you look at all of them, and considering 2020 polls had Biden winning by much larger margins then he actually did, I think it’s probably safe to assume, Kamala is actually behind Trump.

Two, is the campaign really doing that good? I don’t think it is. I think she’s getting hit hard for not doing an interview and I think the voters share the concerns as pundits that she and Walz are so quiet. It’s just a plain old bad strategy, especially against Trump who is able to go off the dome everyday.

You have to understand that Kamala and Walz will go full communism once in the White House.

She’s banking on everyone’s hatred for Trump and people’s stupidity (“time for a woman president!”). As soon as they’re in, radical changes are going to be made and we’re goin to see the worst case of buyers remorse in recorded history.

"A Democratic political action committee (PAC) is launching a $2 million campaign in key House battlegrounds as they sound alarms about Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for the next Republican president. 

Save Democracy PAC, which has backed Democrats in dozens of congressional races, is launching cable and digital ads in eight critical districts across the country as part of its “Stop Project 2025” effort, according to a release shared first with The Hill. 

Among the districts targeted by Save Democracy PAC’s initial round of spending are California’s 13th Congressional District, where Democrat Adam Gray is challenging first-term Republican Rep. John Duarte, and Washington state’s 3rd Congressional District, where first-term Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is headed toward a rematch with a Trump-backed challenger.

"Vice President Harris’ campaign on Thursday will roll out some of her housing policy proposals, including her support for efforts aimed at lowering the cost of rent and helping renters who are struggling financially, according to details obtained by NBC News from a campaign official.

Harris will propose plans to stop data firms from driving up lease rates and plans aimed at stopping Wall Street investors from buying up and reselling homes in bulk at a higher price, according to the proposal.

As part of the rollout, Harris will call on Congress to pass the Preventing the Algorithmic Facilitation of Rental Housing Cartels Act, a bill introduced by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Peter Welch, D-Vt., that they said would prevent corporate landlords from using private equity-backed price-setting tools to raise rents dramatically in communities across the country.

Harris will also call on Congress to pass the Stop Predatory Investing Act, a bill introduced by Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and several other Democratic senators. The bill is designed to stop communities from being taken advantage of by Wall Street investors and distant landlords. The bill would curtail those practices by removing key tax benefits for major investors who acquire large numbers of single-family rental homes.

Senate Democratic candidates in various swing states were already showing leads when President Biden was atop the national party ticket, and those margins have widened in almost every state contest since Harris replaced the president on the ticket last month, the Cook Political Report said Thursday.

A Brief History Of Trying To Tame Drug Prices

The idea of giving the federal government the power to negotiate drug prices, which is what the governments of other economically advanced countries do, goes back at least to the 1980s. But efforts to make it happen in the U.S. consistently ran into tough opposition — from conservatives and, especially, from the drug industry.

You could see that opposition at work in 2003 when then-President George W. Bush signed the bill that first created a drug benefit for Medicare. It was Republican legislation that passed with a few votes from more conservative Democrats. Not only did that law fail to give the government price negotiation authority, it explicitly prohibited the federal government from meddling in prices.

The same kind of opposition was again at work in 2009, when then-President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders were trying to pass what became the Affordable Care Act. In order to avoid a fight with the drug industry, which had killed past efforts at expanding insurance coverage, the law’s architects promised to exclude a provision giving the federal government leverage over prices.

The Obama episode was especially instructive. Democrats for a time had a 60-seat, filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. But roughly a third of those were more conservative lawmakers, mostly from formerly Democratic states in the process of turning Republican.

Desperate to hold onto their seats, they were skittish about big Democratic legislation and heavily dependent on drug industry support for their campaigns. Had Obama and Democratic leaders not ceded to the drug industry and the lawmakers over which it held sway, chances are good the Affordable Care Act wouldn’t have passed at all.

In the decade that followed, most of those Democrats lost their seats, costing the party congressional majorities they only got back in 2018 (in the House) and 2020 (in the Senate). The new Senate majority was the thinnest possible, just 50 seats, but with Harris’ tie-breaker it was enough to pass budget-related legislation and — critically — it had come together mostly with members who were less conservative, less in thrall to Big Pharma, or both.

Among the Senate newcomers in 2020 were two Georgia Democrats, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock; over in the House, the Democratic majority included members such as Michigan’s Elissa Slotkin. All represented constituencies that leaned more red than blue but were trending slowly in a Democratic direction. Not coincidentally, all three lawmakers were wholeheartedly in favor of aggressive action to bring down prescription prices — and all voted “yes” on the IRA reforms.

Still, it wasn’t quite enough to pass strong legislation on prescription prices. Democratic leaders had to wrangle votes from (then-Democratic) Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and a group of House counterparts with ties to drug lobbies. The price these lawmakers extracted was compromise that limited the reforms — by, for example, narrowing the scope of drugs subject to negotiation and nixing extension of some price limits beyond Medicare.

It’s an instructive lesson in the way even tiny, one-time changes in election outcomes can have big, far-reaching effects on policy. It’s hard not to imagine that, in a world where Democrats had just a handful of more votes back in 2022, they could have passed significantly stronger drug pricing reforms ― making a wider array of drugs subject to price negotiation, for example, or extending some of the reforms outside of Medicare.

Advertisement

They might have even secured some of the other policy goals they had been seeking, like creating a paid leave program or making big investments in child care.

Conversely, in a world where Democratic caucuses were slightly smaller, they probably would have gotten even less. Or maybe nothing at all.

What was true in the past is just as true now heading into November, and not just because so much is riding on the presidential race. The difference of just two or three House members, or a single measly senator, could be the difference between future legislation that does a lot or does a little ― or doesn’t happen at all.",1724014456,7,democrats,,The Lesson Hidden Inside The Big News On Drug Prices,"The Lesson Hidden Inside The Big News On Drug Prices

"Vice President Kamala Harris is calling for raising the corporate tax rate to 28%, her first major proposal to raise revenues and finance expensive plans she wants to pursue as president.

Harris campaign spokesman James Singer told NBC News that she would push for a 28% corporate tax rate, calling it “a fiscally responsible way to put money back in the pockets of working people and ensure billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share.”

If enacted, the policy would raise hundreds of billions of dollars, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that 1 percentage point increases in the corporate rate corresponds to about $100 billion over a decade. It would also roll back a big part of former President Donald Trump’s signature legislation in 2017 as president, which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

Trump, meanwhile, recently said he would cut taxes even further if elected president, including on businesses.

Full letter

Dear Mr. President -

Congratulations on a remarkable run. Millions have placed their hopes in you, and all of us, regardless of party, should hope for expanded prosperity and security during your tenure.

This is a unique office, without a clear blueprint for success, so I don't know that any advice from me will be particularly helpful. Still, let me offer a few reflections from the past 8 years.

First, we've both been blessed, in different ways, with great good fortune. Not everyone is so lucky. It's up to us to do everything we can (to) build more ladders of success for every child and family that's willing to work hard.

Second, American leadership in this world really is indispensable. It's up to us, through action and example, to sustain the international order that's expanded steadily since the end of the Cold War, and upon which our own wealth and safety depend.

Third, we are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions -- like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties -- that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it's up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.

And finally, take time, in the rush of events and responsibilities, for friends and family. They'll get you through the inevitable rough patches.

Michelle and I wish you and Melania the very best as you embark on this great adventure, and know that we stand ready to help in any ways which we can.

Good luck and Godspeed,

BO

One might say it is as important for girls to see this so they know that they can achieve this, and be celebrated. Representation matters.

And one might say it’s as important for everyone in between to see this and know that they’re coming along too. They are invited. They are welcomed. They are seen. 

The 19th amendment was just celebrated on August 18, but we often forget that that was really for White women. It was a step, it was important. But when white women celebrated the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920, they did not bring their Black, Brown and Indigenous sisters with them. If they had actually been included, Black women, and Black men for that matter, wouldn’t have still been counting jellybeans in a jar in Alabama in 1964.🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Miss me with, “The 19th amendment was for ALL women. It wasn’t. 

And that’s the thing about this movement with Kamala, (I’m not even in Chicago yet and I can feel the energy from here) it shows that everybody in this country is welcome to come along and she’s going to represent all of us. 

I’ll absolutely be voting @kamalaharris and not just because she’s not trump, but it certainly does help. Not being a convicted felon is definitely a plus.

My right to choose what I need regarding my body and the healthcare associated with it.

Gun safety regulations.

Tough laws to protect the environment.

It would be nice to have a president who doesn’t sit on a gold toilet. The middle class definitely needs somebody fighting for them.

"January 6th is the biggest reason I became a Democrat (have never supported Trump however), and it makes me angry just thinking about it. It makes me furious when conservatives act like it wasn't that big of a deal or that the people were in the right. It was a national tragedy that was an embarrassment to our great nation. I can't wait for our nation and history to start calling it what it really was and stop defending those that were involved. 

I also hope that Mike Pence is remembered for what he did that day. While I dont agree with many of his views, and he's by no means perfect, I can say that I look up to him, and I hope many more people do as well. He could've very easily taken the easy way out and let Trump win. However, this man chose his country instead and did the right thing when it came time to it. With the lackeys sent on him by the former president calling for him to be hung, he still stood his ground. He was a true American patriot, and I hope he gets remembered as a hero for what he did. 

It can be easy to villainize the other side, but we should realize that many of them are just fellow Americans who want what they think is best for the country. You're not going to change their mind by insulting them or refusing to hear anything they have to say. If we lift each other up and can appreciate each other regardless of our beliefs, it becomes a lot easier to feel connected again. There are heroes on both sides.

"Harris hasn’t yet released many details about her strategy to wipe out medical debt, but policy experts say a newly implemented medical debt relief program from North Carolina could offer a road map. 

Earlier this month, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced that nearly 100 hospitals in the state had signed on to participate in the Medical Debt Relief Incentive Program, which he said will incentivize hospitals to eliminate $4 billion in medical debt for 2 million low- and middle-income patients over the next two years.

Vice President Harris closely coordinated with Cooper on the plan and participated in the announcement, according to Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at Stanford University who served on the White House National Economic Council in 2022 and 2023. At a campaign event last week in Raleigh, North Carolina, Harris thanked Cooper for canceling medical debt in his state, and Cooper introduced Harris at the convention Thursday.

Mahoney and other experts said Harris has hinted that the North Carolina plan is something she could implement nationwide if elected to the White House in November.

In an economic policy proposal shared by Harris’ campaign last week, she stated that as president she would “work with states” to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and to “help prevent such debt from accumulating in the future” — a key tentpole of the North Carolina plan.

Mahoney and other experts said Harris has hinted that the North Carolina plan is something she could implement nationwide if elected to the White House in November.

In an economic policy proposal shared by Harris’ campaign last week, she stated that as president she would “work with states” to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and to “help prevent such debt from accumulating in the future” — a key tentpole of the North Carolina plan.

if you're new to this controversy, below per chatG:

""The ""tan suit controversy"" refers to a minor political and media uproar that occurred in August 2014 when then-President Barack Obama wore a tan suit during a press conference. The controversy arose because some critics and media commentators felt that the light-colored suit was too casual or inappropriate for the serious topics being discussed, particularly U.S. foreign policy and military operations against ISIS.

The incident became a symbol of the sometimes trivial nature of political criticism, with many viewing the backlash as disproportionate and indicative of the intense scrutiny faced by Obama during his presidency. The tan suit itself became a meme and a cultural reference point for how minor issues can be blown out of proportion in the media. Despite the controversy, many people, including fashion experts, defended Obama's choice, noting that tan suits are not inherently inappropriate and are commonly worn in warm weather.""

"Nebraska’s top election official has no authority to declare unconstitutional a state law that restores the voting rights of those who’ve been convicted of a felony, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union told the state Supreme Court on Wednesday.

Nebraska Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton countered that Evnen swore an oath to uphold the state constitution and has a duty not to implement laws that he believes are unconstitutional.

Evnen’s order could keep 7,000 or more Nebraska residents from voting in the upcoming election, the ACLU has said. Many of them reside in Nebraska’s Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional District, where both the race for president and Congress could be in play.

The high court is expected to rule before the final deadline to register to vote in the November election. There are several deadlines for registering by mail, online or through a third party. The last day to register to vote is Oct. 25 and must be done in person.

Evnen’s order came after the Nebraska Legislature passed a law, often referred to by its bill number LB20, earlier this year that immediately restores the voting rights of people who’ve successfully completed the terms of their felony sentences. The order was made July 17 — the same day state Attorney General Mike Hilgers issued an opinion saying the new law violates the state constitution’s separation of powers.",1724896716,17,democrats,:snoo: Article ,Nebraska's Supreme Court to decide if those with felony convictions can vote in November,"Nebraska's Supreme Court to decide if those with felony convictions can vote in November Nebraska’s top election official has no authority to declare unconstitutional a state law that restores the voting rights of those who’ve been convicted of a felony, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union told the state Supreme Court on Wednesday.

"Let's be clear: Trump doesn’t genuinely care about abortion policy. He’ll never personally face the issue, and if he did accidentally get someone pregnant, he has the financial means to handle it discreetly. What truly matters to him is securing votes. His base is largely anti-choice, while the swing voters he desperately needs are pro-choice. This has led to a series of inconsistent and conflicting positions on the issue.

Initially, Trump attempted to distance himself by framing abortion as a states' rights matter, implying it wasn’t a presidential responsibility. When that strategy didn’t win him support, he pivoted to being pro-IVF and criticized Florida’s 6-week abortion ban as too extreme. This stance angered anti-choice supporters, so he quickly reversed course, stating he would oppose the Florida abortion amendment, effectively supporting the 6-week ban.

Trump’s flip-flopping on such a critical issue within a mere 48 hours shows a lack of principle and consistency. It's clear that his primary concern isn't the well-being of Americans or the integrity of policy but rather whatever position he thinks will win him the most votes at any given moment.

"Well I am about fed up of hearing loads of crap about Kamala’s proposed price gouging laws. I encourage everybody to look into the FTC’s current lawsuits with companies, mainly grocery chains, that are tackling this issue - but that is not the point of this post.

I wanted to share with you all Executive Order 13910 signed by President Donald Trump himself on March 26, 2020.

It states:

(i) the authority of the President conferred by section 102 of the Act to prevent hoarding of health and medical resources necessary to respond to the spread of COVID-19 within the United States, including the authority to prescribe conditions with respect to the accumulation of such resources, and to designate any material as a scarce material, or as a material the supply of which would be threatened by persons accumulating the material either in excess of reasonable demands of business, personal, or home consumption, or for the purpose of resale at prices in excess of prevailing market prices;



I think you smart people understand what this means. This essentially gave the Federal government power to shut down price gouging of pandemic response related materials, signed by the man himself. 

I’m a little confused why I haven’t seen this brought up in the news. But then again the media just labeled Kamala a communist for suggesting these laws and then they moved on. It’s also possible that this doesn’t mean what I think it means - so if that’s the case, please let me know. Otherwise, enjoy sharing.

"Excerpts from an interview with…Bradley Onishi, president of the Institute for Religion, Media, and Civic Engagement and professor of Religion and Philosophy at the University of San Francisco…

What do you believe that those of us who are outside of the ""Christian"" community in America misunderstand about its members and their values and politics?  


I have the privilege of speaking across the country, at both progressive and liberal houses of worship, and to a lot of secular and atheist organizations. There's often a deep misunderstanding on the part of both communities. Believe it or not, the members of all of those organizations, while they are religiously divergent from one another, are often discussing the same exact things such as protecting reproductive rights and fighting systemic racism. There's an emphasis in both communities on democracy, on freedom, on equality, on inclusion, on having a public square where we can all exist as who we are, and not be persecuted or live in fear.



So, for those who are not in a religious community, I would say the following: don't buy the idea that all people of faith are following one myopic form of the Christian tradition or any other. For those who are of those religious traditions, I would say this: please understand that the people who are in humanist and agnostic and freethinkers’ societies and groups spend most of their time organizing, mobilizing, and finding ways to combat the anti-democratic, racist and xenophobic movements in their communities.

"Former President Donald Trump spent the weekend struggling to solidify his position on abortion. The timing for Democrats couldn’t have been better.

The Harris campaign on Tuesday launched a 50-stop “Reproductive Freedom” bus tour that kicked off in Trump’s adopted home state of Florida. It came just days after the former president said he planned to vote “no” on a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights into the state Constitution — but also muddled the issue when he said “you need more time” than Florida’s current laws making most abortion illegal after six weeks into a pregnancy.

Trump isn’t in danger of losing Florida in November — underscored by the fact that neither Vice President Kamala Harris nor her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz showed up to Tuesday’s event. But by choosing a location roughly 10 miles south of Palm Beach, Democrats made it clear they were trolling Trump over the issue. After gathering 500 supporters into a ballroom, the Harris campaign drove its newly minted bus by Mar-a-Lago even though Trump was in Bedminster, New Jersey.

Their move to campaign in Florida highlights how abortion continues to be an issue that Trump is vulnerable on, especially after he spent months steering clear of saying how he’d vote on Florida’s abortion amendment and then sending somewhat conflicting messages on it.

Democrats chose Florida to show how the state’s abortion laws, signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, put Trump in a political bind.

"Former President Trump is scaling back his campaigning in three states he was targeting just six weeks ago, a sign of how Kamala Harris' rise in the polls has shifted the dynamics of the presidential race.

Trump's campaign is placing less emphasis on New Hampshire, Minnesota and Virginia. Instead, it's pouring resources into the ""Blue Wall"" states — Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — that are crucial to both sides' chances of victory.

"Montana Republican Tim Sheehy leads Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) in one of the most critical races of the 2024 election, according to new AARP polling.

With West Virginia all but certain to flip Republican, Democrats have to win the eight other competitive seats to keep the Senate at a 50-50 margin — and hope to have a VP Tim Walz as tie-breaker.

Polling is tight in several other battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio, but Montana appears to be the most perilous for Democrats.

New polling by AARP shows Sheehy up 49% to Tester's 41% when the full ballot with third-party candidates is included — and 51% to 45% in a head-to-head race. The margin of error for the representative sample is ± 4 percentage points.

Protecting the Tester seat is the Democratic Party's top priority in the Senate. Democrats have poured $128 million into Montana Senate race advertising and ad reservations so far this cycle, compared to $109 million from Republicans, according to AdImpact data. Democrats for years have had a substantial fundraising advantage over Republicans.

Tester is a unique candidate — a Democrat who has managed to win in an otherwise deeply-red state for three elections in a row. The race is right around the margin of error — the kind of tight race Tester has won before. But this is the first time he has had to campaign with former President Trump on the ballot.",1725570701,33,democrats,:snoo: Article ,Poll: Jon Tester faces tough deficit in pivotal Montana Senate race,"Poll: Jon Tester faces tough deficit in pivotal Montana Senate race Montana Republican Tim Sheehy leads Sen.

"The nonpartisan group Cook Political Report has shifted half a dozen House races toward Democrats and two toward Republicans, as Democrats see their financial advantage and enthusiasm rise after Vice President Harris replaced President Biden at the top of the ticket. 

The changes do away with one toss-up race and add three new ones, for a combined total of 24 toss-up contests on the table this fall.

Democrats need to net only four seats to take the majority this fall, and they appear better positioned to do so after the shake-up in the presidential race, according to the analysis. Still, the fight for the lower chamber will come down to a few dozen seats where neither party has a clear advantage at this point. 

The race for incumbent Rep. Don Bacon’s (R) seat in Nebraska and Rep. Michelle Steel’s (R) seat in California have both moved from “lean Republican” to “toss up.” In Ohio, Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur’s race has strengthened from “toss up” to “lean Democrat.” Rep. Henry Cuellar’s (D) race in Texas has become a likely seat for Democrats, and Rep. Jared Mosckowitz’s (D) in Florida has shifted into “solid” blue territory. In Iowa, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks’s race has softened from “likely” to “lean” Republican. 

Cook also moved two races toward Republicans. Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola’s race in red Alaska shifted into a toss-up, after one Trump-backed Republican candidate dropped out of the race to let the party coalesce support behind just one GOP challenger.

The open seat in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District also moved from “lean” to “likely” Republican. Conservative firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert (R), who holds the seat, is running this cycle for Colorado’s 4th Congressional District instead.

If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most.

Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.

I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.

I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early.

When Biden stepped aside and said Kamala is the taking over...my literal words were oh no.

After more and more stories/perspective came out of Biden stepping aside when he did to let the Republicans trash him at the convention and then let Kamala run full steam ahead afterwards...I was like oh yes

And then just watching her campaign, talk, and actually talk like most of us think while still giving political policies and actually not taking the high road in talking about Republicans like they've done to us for so many years

Then picking waltz who is just, maybe, the best pick we could've gotten for a vp...likeable, and hardly a shroud of negativity except maybe exiting the military after giving proper notice and before his time to leave for Iraq..the nerve

"Hello my fellow democrats. I have a question since I have been discussing this with some friends.

This is the point, I just want to get some other perspectives.

Trump debate was a disaster, Harris was better almost in all aspects from looking presidential, better body language, looking at him (he never looked at her) he fell in all the traps she laid out for him, he was fact checked, couldn’t lie, he was humiliated. We all saw it.

Now is the question, let’s assume for a moment that we had the opposite outcome and Harris was the one stumble. 

My friends and I reached the conclusion that this will be it and Trump again will win.

How come the opposite is not true ? How come after such a great display for Harris and such sorry display from Trump , they still basically tied?

What else she needs to do ? Why we don’t see the needle moving ? 

WTF is happening? This debate was watched by 67 million people, all news (even Fox) reported that Trump did badly, how come we don’t see a strong resurgence of Harris support?

Too early to tell? Answers please since I am shifting my pants off.

"I keep seeing it in article after article: the Harris/Walz campaign needs to focus more on finances and inflation, because it's the reality for so many people right now.

Let me be clear—I’m 100% behind Harris/Walz. I love them, and I fully support their leadership. I don’t place any blame on this administration for what happened with the pandemic or inflation. But the financial pain people are feeling is real. For instance, I had to give up my car in 2020, and now I walk or rely on public transportation because driving became unaffordable. My rent has gone up $100 a month over the past three years, and here in Michigan, there’s nothing to stop landlords from hiking rent to whatever price they want.

So, here’s my take on how they can address this financial pain and move us forward by improvements to their stump speech. I really would love to see lots of comments on what you would add to their stump speech as well, in terms of specifics, to help them communicate more with persuading more undecided voters. Here it is:

“We know the pain families across the country are feeling today at the grocery store and in your monthly bills. It’s real, and we hear you. When you walk into a grocery store and see those prices, it hits hard. But I want to be crystal clear: while our economy faced unprecedented challenges from the pandemic, we’re turning the tide—and the future is bright. We’re already seeing inflation cool, and I’m running for President with Tim Walz because we have a plan to accelerate this recovery for all Americans, not just the wealthy few.

Over the past three years, we’ve faced extraordinary challenges—challenges that many said we couldn’t overcome. When we came into office, inflation was rising globally, driven by supply chain issues and skyrocketing demand as the world began recovering from the pandemic. We have made critical investments to bring inflation down, and we’re working to lower prices even further.

**First, lowering costs—especially for groceries and essentials—will be one of our top priorities.**

To ease the cost of living, we will take a multi-pronged approach that focuses on lowering grocery prices and other essential costs. We will expand programs to help families afford groceries in the short term while we tackle the root causes of rising prices. We’ll also continue investing in local food systems—supporting small and medium-sized farms and farmers' markets, so consumers aren’t dependent on costly, monopolized supply chains. And we’re going to expand the power of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to prevent price gouging by corporate grocery giants. We know that big corporations are inflating prices, and that stops in a Harris administration.

We’re also investing heavily in renewable energy infrastructure—to lower transportation and fuel costs. That’s important because transportation is a key factor in the rising cost of food and goods. By moving toward energy solutions like electric vehicles and more efficient logistics, we’ll drive down the costs of getting products to your local store.

**Energy Policy and Job Creation**

Some worry that environmental policies might eliminate jobs—especially in traditional industries—but here’s the truth: investing in renewable energy does the opposite. We are creating new, good-paying jobs in clean energy while also supporting workers in traditional industries. Tim Walz has proven in Minnesota that it’s possible to grow renewable energy without leaving any community behind. We're committed to expanding training programs so workers can transition into these emerging fields.

**Job Creation and Raising Wages**

You deserve a job that pays you fairly for the hard work you do. But that’s not enough—we’re committed to creating good-paying, union jobs through investments in infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing. Tim Walz and I believe that unions are the backbone of the middle class. That’s why we’re going to strengthen the PRO Act, to make it easier for workers to organize and negotiate for better wages, safer working conditions, and more security for their families. When we make it easier for employees to join unions, we protect the dignity of work and ensure that everyone—from factory workers to teachers—gets their fair share.

**Expanding Opportunities for Small Businesses**

Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and we will create more opportunities for them to succeed. We’ll push for expanded access to low-interest loans and microloans for small businesses and simplify the process for owners to access that capital. Under a Harris/Walz administration, we’ll strengthen the Small Business Administration (SBA) to better serve the needs of women-, veteran-, and minority-owned businesses.

We also recognize that regulations can often hold businesses back. That’s why we’re committed to streamlining unnecessary regulations that burden small businesses, while ensuring we still hold large corporations accountable. We’ll work to simplify tax codes for small businesses, making it easier for entrepreneurs to grow without being buried in red tape.

**The Future of America’s Economy**

The truth is, this election isn’t just about today—it’s about the future. Tim and I are fighting to build an America where everyone has a fair shot, where no one is left behind, and where hard work is rewarded with the opportunity to get ahead.

That’s why we’re focused on expanding job training and education programs, including apprenticeships and affordable college pathways. We’ll expand Pell Grants and strengthen community college programs so that anyone—whether you’re just starting out or changing careers—has access to the skills and training they need for the jobs of tomorrow.  

**Addressing Republican Concerns**

We also hear those who say that some of our policies might be slowing economic growth or causing burdens on small businesses. That’s why we’re laser-focused on cutting unnecessary regulations that hurt entrepreneurs while still holding large corporations accountable. Our approach will allow small businesses to thrive, create jobs, and keep America competitive in the global market.

Together, we will build an economy that works for all—where prices are fair, jobs are plentiful, unions are strong, and small businesses can thrive. We’re not just recovering from the challenges of the past—we’re building a future where every American can succeed. 

Let’s keep moving forward. Let’s keep creating jobs. Let’s keep lowering costs. And let’s ensure that every worker, every family, and every small business has the opportunity to thrive.”",1726333335,61,democrats,:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:,The Focus on Finances and Inflation: Thoughts on Additions to the Stump Speech,"The Focus on Finances and Inflation: Thoughts on Additions to the Stump Speech I keep seeing it in article after article: the Harris/Walz campaign needs to focus more on finances and inflation, because it's the reality for so many people right now.

"While President Joe Biden was hosting a celebration of Black excellence at the White House with lawmakers, advocates and celebrities this past week, Kamala Harris was instead headed off to Pennsylvania.

"I am entirely fed up with the state of things. For three election cycles, there is less than zero reason for things to be ever-so-typically neck and neck. The merchandise, money, echo chambers, conspiracies and memes never swirled this way around McCain, Romney, Bush or Reagan as much as they do with Trump (see IQ-deleting image above).

I've recently been rewatching old debates between Presidents, from JFK versus Nixon, all the way to Obama versus Romney. And oh my lord, is it ever so coordial, polite, normal, open and kind. There was fact-checking mid-debate as recently as Obama-Romney, although it feels like a lifetime ago, and politics were normal and never egregious. Republicans, not too long ago, even if you disagreed with them, had class and could look good while wearing a suit and speaking properly to you.

It is a slap in the fucking face that this much actually flies in the Republican party. Things are absolutely unrecognizably sloppy, vile, tasteless, shameless and fake. This much hypocrisy, creepy fixations on women's bodies, this much utterly criminal and sinister intent, poor hygeine from Trump as repeatedly espoused (???), and this little basis in the reality you and I know to live in and be, is tantalizing, depressing, and sick. And - especially when balanced by how competent, appropriate, presidential, collected and cool Kamala is - it should never, NEVER, from the party that forced Nixon to resign, let alone the one that came down on Bill Clinton for a single affair so much - merit approximately HALF of the APPROVAL of the ENTIRE UNITED STATES.

Twelve years is a lot of time to do a lot of damage, and yet, it's so quick in the first place that it leaves millions across the entire world scrambling to understand, what? How? Why?

There are two good points that seem to stick, though - that MAGA is a ""cult"", and that Trump and Vance are ""weird"". 

The only possible explanation, the *only* one, and from what I've witnessed firsthand, is that among a certain demographic of white trash, Trump is cool as a label, the same way it's ""cool"" to wear an overpriced piece of clothing that says ""Supreme"" or ""Gucci"". It's tasteless there, and it's tasteless and reasonless here. I've been to many a party -even here in deep blue Massachusetts - where people are having a wild time clubbing to some top 10 radio with drinks, clothes are short, attention spans are shorter, and suddenly someone floats out a giant Trump sign or flag and everyone goes wild. Sometimes you'll be out on the lakeside, or the shore, and the most obnoxious, meat headed football chads and blonde bimbos will come over the horizon with a boat decked in red, white, and blue, complete with a gigantic Trump banner, blaring ""Party in the USA"" and flipping middle fingers to passersby. You can tell they're not good people, and their knowledge of economy is flatter than a flatline. This only works because it's not cool to be smart. It's cool to be ""many"".

All they know is their small white town, and they're shown in the movies that it's cool to tell people to go fuck themselves and get over it. That is all the world experience they have. Trump, as legitimately incompetent and as surefire a bad president as he is, responds to something in these people. Because, he, can make you think he is cool.

That is where it starts and where it ends.

If we HAVE to fight this cult mentality, not through documented, clear, concise communication, like the Debate, where the choice is clear and yet the polls only infuriatingly shift marginally, because people have made up their minds -  maybe we have to fight the psychology on their terms. If we can make Trump uncool, and we can label him as creepy and confused and smelly and dumb and sloppy as he is, rather than just saying a bunch of figures and numbers, maybe *that* will break up the bad fever dream and the party. 

If only a slight lead in the polls can be gained back from a professional A+ debate, instead of a country-wide landslide sweep away from MAGA, then this election isn't about convincing people; it's about how to break down and dispose of white trash.

Calling him ""dangerous"" is actually something of a complement. MAGA white boys like being thought of as ""dangerous"", it makes the Andrew Tate crowd feel powerful, sexy, strong, and self-important. Some people want the anarchy of being the bad guy. Calling Trump dangerous and a dictator doesn't work and it actually helps encourage him more in the long run. His supporters have started to like when he says that. Am I overthinking it that if Democrats are more on brand and can call him out as ""creepy"" and ""uncool"" the same way they're calling him ""weird"", then that will change enough face to end MAGA while it's down and out?

"Alan Smith ran as a write-in Democratic candidate in 2022 because he wanted answers from his state senator, Jake Hoffman, one of the 11 Arizona Republicans who signed a fake electoral certificate declaring that Donald Trump had won the state in 2020 after President Biden won the state by 10,457 votes.

Smith is one of dozens of people across the country who are running longshot campaigns for local and state office in an effort to oust Republican elected officials who baselessly question the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, or who have interfered with certifying subsequent elections.

With Democrats down only one seat in the Arizona Senate, winning the historically Republican district, which includes part of Mesa and other suburbs east of Phoenix, could result in a tie between the parties in the chamber.

Smith and Banks are just two of the dozens of candidates who are challenging the 334 public officials − from lieutenant governor to local boards that certify election results − in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin who have denied election outcomes, tried to overturn an election or made statements to undermine an election. Public Wise, a left-leaning nonprofit group that advocates for representative democracy, identified the officials earlier this year.

"Two Florida ballot measures on abortion and recreational marijuana are turning the state’s elections upside down, worrying Republicans while giving Democrats hope in this year’s presidential battle and in a key Senate race.

"Five years ago, on September 15, 2019, after about a six-week hiatus during the summer, I wrote a Facebook post that started:
“Many thanks to all of you who have reached out to see if I'm okay. I am, indeed (aside from having been on the losing end of an encounter with a yellow jacket this afternoon!). I've been moving, setting up house, and finishing the new book. Am back and ready to write, but now everything seems like such a dumpster fire it's very hard to know where to start. So how about a general overview of how things at the White House look to me, today....” 

I wrote a review of Trump’s apparent mental decline amidst his faltering presidency, stonewalling of investigations of potential criminal activity by him or his associates, stacking of the courts, and attempting to use the power of the government to help his 2020 reelection. 

Then I noted that the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA), had written a letter to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, on Friday, September 13, telling Maguire he knew that a whistleblower had filed a complaint with the inspector general of the intelligence community, who had deemed the complaint “credible” and ""urgent.” This meant that the complaint was supposed to be sent on to the House Intelligence Committee. But, rather than sending it to the House as the law required, Maguire had withheld it. Schiff’s letter told Maguire that he’d better hand it over. Schiff speculated that Maguire was covering up evidence of crimes by the president or his closest advisors.

And I added: “None of this would fly in America if the Senate, controlled by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, were not aiding and abetting him.”

“This is the story of a dictator on the rise,” I wrote, “taking control of formerly independent branches of government, and using the power of his office to amass power.”

Readers swamped me with questions. So I wrote another post answering them and trying to explain the news, which began breaking at a breathtaking pace. 

And so these Letters from an American were born.

In the five years since then, the details of the Ukraine scandal—the secret behind the whistleblower complaint in Schiff’s letter—revealed that then-president Trump was running his own private foreign policy to strong-arm Ukraine into helping his reelection campaign. That effort brought to light more of the story of Russian support for Trump’s 2016 campaign, which until Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine seemed to be in exchange for lifting sanctions the Obama administration imposed against Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. 

The February 2022 invasion brought renewed attention to the Mariupol Plan, confirmed by Trump’s 2016 campaign advisor Paul Manafort, that Russia expected a Trump administration to permit Russian president Vladimir Putin to take over eastern Ukraine. 
The Ukraine scandal of 2019 led to Trump’s first impeachment trial for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, then his acquittal on those charges and his subsequent purge of career government officials, whom he replaced with Trump loyalists. 

Then, on February 7, just two days after Senate Republicans acquitted him, Trump picked up the phone and called veteran journalist Bob Woodward to tell him there was a deadly new virus spreading around the world. It was airborne, he explained, and was five times “more deadly than even your strenuous flus.” “This is deadly stuff,” he said. He would not share that information with other Americans, though, continuing to play down the virus in hopes of protecting the economy.",1726524711,112,democrats,,Letters From an American by Heather Cox Richardson (quote to follow) is worth the Substack subscription price,"Letters From an American by Heather Cox Richardson (quote to follow) is worth the Substack subscription price Five years ago, on September 15, 2019, after about a six-week hiatus during the summer, I wrote a Facebook post that started:

Readers swamped me with questions. So I wrote another post answering them and trying to explain the news, which began breaking at a breathtaking pace. 

And so these Letters from an American were born.

In the five years since then, the details of the Ukraine scandal—the secret behind the whistleblower complaint in Schiff’s letter—revealed that then-president Trump was running his own private foreign policy to strong-arm Ukraine into helping his reelection campaign. That effort brought to light more of the story of Russian support for Trump’s 2016 campaign, which until Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine seemed to be in exchange for lifting sanctions the Obama administration imposed against Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. 

The February 2022 invasion brought renewed attention to the Mariupol Plan, confirmed by Trump’s 2016 campaign advisor Paul Manafort, that Russia expected a Trump administration to permit Russian president Vladimir Putin to take over eastern Ukraine. 
The Ukraine scandal of 2019 led to Trump’s first impeachment trial for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, then his acquittal on those charges and his subsequent purge of career government officials, whom he replaced with Trump loyalists. 

Then, on February 7, just two days after Senate Republicans acquitted him, Trump picked up the phone and called veteran journalist Bob Woodward to tell him there was a deadly new virus spreading around the world. It was airborne, he explained, and was five times “more deadly than even your strenuous flus.” “This is deadly stuff,” he said. He would not share that information with other Americans, though, continuing to play down the virus in hopes of protecting the economy.",0.06,0.85,0.091,0.9691,positive

"Black Voters Matter, the nonpartisan national organization focused on mobilizing Black Americans to the polls, will spend at least $15 million on voter engagement efforts through Election Day, its co-founder and executive director, Cliff Albright, said.

The group’s plans, which were shared exclusively with The New York Times on Monday, will span nearly a dozen presidential battlegrounds, including Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. They include radio advertisements, bus tours across cities and campuses of historically Black colleges and a vast canvassing operation aimed at increasing Black turnout in swing states and the Deep South. A key goal, Mr. Albright said, is to not only engage voters but get them to engage one another.

The mobilization efforts will include some programming focused on Black men, a voting bloc that is more open to supporting former President Donald J. Trump, according to polling and focus group data. While the vast majority of Black men are likely to support Ms. Harris, Mr. Trump has sought to make inroads, which could matter at the margins in close races.

"On debate night and since the debate, I've heard interviews with people would claim to be undecided. 

Some of them claim they don't know Kamala Harris, but are open to hearing more about her. Others claim they need to hear more about what she will do for them. Still others say she seems more presidential, but don't know anything about her policies. 

Like many of you, Kamala Harris isn't a new name. Most of us, I suspect, have watched her debate on the Senate floor. We've watched her grill Supreme Court Justices. We watched her questioning Jeff Sessions and making him quite nervous. 

If Joe Biden hadn't run in 2020, her or Cory Booker were candidates I would have stood behind. 

Kamala hasn't just dropped out of the sky. She has been in the news for years. She's also the current VP. And while they get don't get the limelight at all when being VP, surely voters don't think she was just picked at random. 

I debated with someone yesterday that was quite unhappy Harris was assumed to be the candidate when Biden dropped out. I had to go through the entire history of the primary process for them to back down. They went on to say they were sure she will do a great job, but that she wasn't actually elected and they didn't know anything about her. 

I'm 43. Friends of mine that are in their late 20s or early 30s know who Harris is. The only person I know that doesn't know who she is an acquaintance that is in their late 60s. They don't read/watch the news. Only a high school education. He's made it clear he ""isn't voting for a woman"" and likely won't vote at all. 

TLDR;

For someone to be ""undecided"" at this point, after so many years of Trump, are these people basically ignoring all things political? Do they tune out any discussions or any news pertaining to politics? I really don't understand how this could still be a thing.

"With the recent fed rate cuts, the economy seems to be recovering more and more as we get closer to the election. Gas prices are now reaching well below $3 in some states. Grocery prices are coming down as well (with regards to milk, eggs, bread). Look at the stock market for goodness sake. For the everyday person, their opinion of what makes for a great economy is improving. Only, they still feel like it's not or will tell you it isn't despite all data saying otherwise.

Hearing people actually say that the economy was better under Trump really confused me. Trump's administration did very little to grow the economy. If you look at the previous administrations growth (Obama's administration), all Trump needed to do was keep everything as it was and the economy would have just been on auto pilot. But when he put his tariffs in place, and just before the pandemic, things started to change.

So it's really surprising that people can remember those few brief years before the pandemic and make it seem like they had so much more wealth and spending money with Trump in the White House. I simply don't believe it. I think they have heard people say over and over that we we're better off economically under Trump and they are just believing it. Nothing is pointing to an overly booming economy like Trump likes to tout. In fact, his record just doesn't show it.

We all know that once the pandemic hit, supply chains were hit with issues world wide. Cost of things were sky rocketing. We're seeing that all stabilize now. In fact, Trump tried to, just today, make it sound like the economy must have been horrible for the Fed to cut the rate as much as they did. He also claimed it was cut for political reasons. 

Personally, my family never felt any kind of economic squeeze. Sure we saw some prices go up, but it was never to a point where things weren't affordable. Couple that with record profits from some companies and I think what has happened is some prices actually didn't go up that much while some companies raised their prices because they could and kept them there.

"House Republicans have shifted gears as they race to avoid a government shutdown, eyeing a three-month stopgap spending bill — in lieu of a six-month extension — while dropping their demand for tougher voting rules as part of the package. 

Top appropriators have already launched bipartisan talks in both chambers, and senior lawmakers said they expect the continuing resolution (CR) will extend 2024 funding into December while excluding the more stringent voter-eligibility rules demanded by former President Trump.

Top appropriators have already launched bipartisan talks in both chambers, and senior lawmakers said they expect the continuing resolution (CR) will extend 2024 funding into December while excluding the more stringent voter-eligibility rules demanded by former President Trump.

"The difference between the Democrats and the Republicans in this election is stark, and it reflects a systemic problem that has been growing in the U.S. since the 1980s. 

Democracy depends on at least two healthy political parties that can compete for voters on a level playing field. Although the men who wrote the Constitution hated the idea of political parties, they quickly figured out that parties tie voters to the mechanics of Congress and the presidency.

And they do far more than that. Before political thinkers legitimized the idea of political opposition to the king, disagreeing with the person in charge usually led to execution or banishment for treason. Parties allowed for the idea of loyal and legitimate opposition, which in turn allowed for the peaceful transition of power. That peaceful exchange enabled the people to choose their leaders and leaders to relinquish power safely. Parties also create a system for criticizing people in power, which helps to weed out corrupt or unfit leaders.

But those benefits of a party system depend on a level political playing field for everyone, so that a party must constantly compete for voters by testing which policies are most popular and getting rid of the corrupt or unstable leaders voters would reject. 

In the 1980s, radical Republican leaders set out to dismantle the government that regulated business, provided a basic social safety net, promoted infrastructure, and protected civil rights. But that system was popular, and to overcome the majority who favored it, they began to tip the political playing field in their direction. They began to suppress voting by Democrats by insisting that Democrats were engaging in “voter fraud.” At the same time, they worked to delegitimize their opponents by calling them “socialists” or “communists” and claiming that they were trying to destroy the United States. By the 1990s, extremists in the party were taking power by purging traditional Republicans from it.

And yet, voters still elected Democrats, and after they put President Barack Obama into the White House in 2008, the Republican State Leadership Committee in 2010 launched Operation REDMAP, or Redistricting Majority Project. The plan was to take over state legislatures so Republicans would control the new district maps drawn after the 2010 census, especially in swing states like Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. It worked, and Republican legislatures in those states and elsewhere carved up state maps into dramatically gerrymandered districts.",1726839645,12,democrats,,Party differences and their history (Heather Cox Richardson),"Party differences and their history (Heather Cox Richardson) The difference between the Democrats and the Republicans in this election is stark, and it reflects a systemic problem that has been growing in the U.S. since the 1980s.

"The prospect of a President Kamala Harris facing down a Republican-controlled Senate is coming into focus as she rises in the 2024 contest, even as GOP hopes of capturing the Senate grow because of improving polling in a pivotal Montana race.

A Republican-controlled chamber could thwart Harris’ nominees to fill out her administration and the courts, along with her legislative agenda. Top Senate Republicans told NBC News she would need their sign-off to secure votes on any judicial nominees, including for the Supreme Court. And some Harris supporters worry that without a united Congress, she would struggle to get much done legislatively.

The prospect of a split Congress looms over a possible Harris win even if Democrats have a strong year and sweep every swing state. To capture the Senate, Republicans have to flip just two seats in solidly red states — West Virginia, which Democrats have conceded, and Montana, where Democratic Sen. Jon Tester trails in most polls — while holding seats in GOP-friendly Florida and Texas.

Under that divided-government scenario, Harris would be the first president since 1989 to enter office without her party controlling both chambers of Congress. It would put her in uncharted waters given the polarization between the two parties in recent decades, with no guarantee that any major judicial nominees, Cabinet picks or legislative items would get a vote.

While a split Congress would require the two parties to negotiate on must-pass bills like funding the government and authorizing the Pentagon, Harris’ other legislative pursuits — including Medicare drug price negotiations, cracking down on grocery price gouging and new investments in housing — would be at the mercy of a Republican Party that has aggressively criticized her ideas.",1726842166,75,democrats,:snoo: Article ,"Harris could win the presidency but lose the Senate, giving Republicans a veto over her agenda and judges","Harris could win the presidency but lose the Senate, giving Republicans a veto over her agenda and judges The prospect of a President Kamala Harris facing down a Republican-controlled Senate is coming into focus as she rises in the 2024 contest, even as GOP hopes of capturing the Senate grow because of improving polling in a pivotal Montana race.

In those districts, the Republican candidates were virtually guaranteed election, so they focused not on attracting voters with popular policies but on amplifying increasingly extreme talking points to excite the party’s base. That drove the party farther and farther to the right. By 2012, political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein warned that the Republican Party had “become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.”

At the same time, the skewed playing field meant that candidates who were corrupt or bonkers did not get removed from the political mix after opponents pounced on their misdeeds and misstatements, as they would have been in a healthy system.

When a political party has so thoroughly walled itself off from the majority, there are two options. One is to become full-on authoritarian and suppress the majority, often with violence. Such a plan is in Project 2025, which calls for a strong executive to take control of the military and the judicial system and to use that power to impose his will.    

The other option is that enough people in the majority reject the extremists to create a backlash that not only replaces them, but also establishes a level playing field.

Some white evangelicals are also distancing themselves from Trump.

"On September 16, CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten wrote that while it’s “[p]retty clear that [Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala] Harris is ahead nationally right now… [h]er advantage in the battlegrounds is basically nil. Average it all, Harris’[s] chance of winning the popular vote is 70%. Her chance of winning the electoral college is 50%.” Two days later, on September 18, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) skipped votes in the Senate to travel to Nebraska, where he tried to convince state legislators to switch the state’s system of allotting electoral votes by district to a winner-take-all system. That effort so far appears unsuccessful. 

In a country of 50 states and Washington, D.C.—a country of more than 330 million people—presidential elections are decided in just a handful of states, and it is possible for someone who loses the popular vote to become president. We got to this place thanks to the Electoral College, and to two major changes made to it since the ratification of the Constitution. 

The men who debated how to elect a president in 1787 worried terribly about making sure there were hedges around the strong executive they were creating so that he could not become a king. 

Some of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention wanted Congress to choose the president, but this horrified others who believed that a leader and Congress would collude to take over the government permanently. Others liked the idea of direct election of the president, but this worried delegates from smaller states, who thought that big states would simply be able to name their own favorite sons. It also worried those who pointed out that most voters would have no idea which were the leading men in other states, leaving a national institution, like the organization of Revolutionary War officers called the Society of the Cincinnati, the power to get its members to support their own leader, thus finding a different way to create a dictator. 

Ultimately, the framers came up with the election of a president by a group of men well known in their states but not currently office-holders, who would meet somewhere other than the seat of government and would disband as soon as the election was over. Each elector in this so-called Electoral College would cast two votes for president. The man with the most votes would be president, and the man with the second number of votes would be vice president (a system that the Twelfth Amendment ended in 1804). The number of electors would be equal to the number of senators and representatives allotted to each state in Congress. If no candidate earned a majority, the House of Representatives would choose the president, with each state delegation casting a single vote.

"TLDR: my roommate, who i've know my whole life and care about deeply, is a smart and fun guy but got caught in the conservative politics of our small town home. he religiously listens to tim pool and other grifters. what do i do? how do i better understand where he's coming from?

for my background, i am an 18 year old college freshman at a university in indiana. i grew up in a small suburban neighborhood of fort wayne, if anyone know it. as is typical of communities like that, it is chock full of people who just don't think too hard. vapid religious types who like trump for their own misinformation-fueled, fox news reasons. just not a lot going on with their mental faculties. my parents are like kinda religious if you pressed them about it but never made me or my sister go to church or anything like that, which i am so thankful for. because of that i was never indoctrinated into any belief system, religious or political. when the world fell apart in 2020, my dad is conservative so i decided to be one as well! matt walsh and ben shapiro enjoyer unfortunately. it took like until 2022 for me to grow the fuck up and MATURE, at least the small amount of maturing it takes to recognize the right for what it is. also papa gut helped me tremendously, if you know of him. i'm now an atheist, definitely liberal-leaning guy who doesn't even have to think about the first presidential candidate i'll get to vote for.

my good friend and roommate, (male, 19) whom i've known for my entire life, in my opinion, has succumbed to the mental traps of the community from which we both came. he's an adopted son to an uber-religious, maga supporting, anti-woke, pro-life, family. but he's an incredible person. an anime enjoyer. super smart and funny. we share so much of the same interests and humor. i knew he was always right leaning i just didn't know to what extent.

we were watching the debate in our dorm room when the candidates began speaking about ukraine. suddenly, the most doom-and-gloom russian propaganda speech came out of his mouth. ""ukraine has no shot of winning at this point anyway, we shouldn't be there"" a feeling of dread washed over me but i put it aside and he kept saying all these weird right-wing obscure knowledge and allegations against both kamala and walz and i became utterly spooked. the next day, i passively glance to his phone and see what he is listening to. TIM POOL TIM POOL TIM POOL. my stomach dropped. the man who literally took russian money to spew their shit. i no longer wondered where these opinions came from. just like a typical right-winger, parroting from their favorite grifter.

it just hurts me that someone so smart and so perceptive can shut off the thinking part of his brain and have the opinions of my near 60-year-old father. to support a candidate who actively tried to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power. but i feel i can't blame him. his whole life has been in an environment where those views are the norm, i just figured he'd be smart enough to see through them. i have to actively shove away this part of him to enjoy his company, luckily he doesn't ever want to talk with me about these things. the mind virus implants itself deep. should i even attempt to broach the subject or should this just be a no-go area for us? we're so young i know he could change but who would i be to try to change him? if tried to change challenge his views, would he not just think of me as what i think of him? any tips to genuinely cope with this would be helpful as well. thanks.",1727387059,10,democrats,,help me understand,"help me understand TLDR: my roommate, who i've know my whole life and care about deeply, is a smart and fun guy but got caught in the conservative politics of our small town home. he religiously listens to tim pool and other grifters. what do i do? how do i better understand where he's coming from?

"Although Harris attended a panel in a South Carolina barbershop in November 2019, she seems to have spent little time visiting Black barbershops during her current bid for the presidency — to her detriment. In addition to several Black male celebrities who have associated themselves with Donald Trump, such as actor and rapper Ice Cube (star of the movie “Barbershop”), a new NAACP poll reveals that more than one-fourth of Black men under 50 plan to vote for Trump.

Harris could easily make her case in the thousands of barbershops that dot America. It is there where Black men of varied socioeconomic status and age gather to get haircuts, while socializing and discussing issues of the day.

Harris’s team has effectively used social media and influencers to target Gen Z. Harris has toured dozens of small, local businesses. She should remember the barbershop is a historically important business and social space for Black communities.

Because barbershops in working-class urban neighborhoods are also frequented by middle-class Black men who live in more affluent, suburban areas, the barbershop could also be a site for Harris to reach suburban, politically moderate swing voters and older generations who are less likely to encounter her messages on social media. She could reach Black men who are eligible but not registered to vote.

Harris could recruit Black barbers to talk to their customers about making a plan to vote, verify their voter registration at voter-registration stations, and outline the main issues on the ballot. 

Harris, who has mostly avoided discussing her race and gender, should lean into the powerful optics of Black barbershops, just as President Biden and former President Barack Obama did. She should keep the longstanding tradition of Black politicians visiting the barbershop during their campaign to signal her interest and commitment to the issues and needs of Black communities.

"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is launching a new digital ad Tuesday slamming Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance as “extremist” and a “danger to our democracy.”

The spot argues Vance “could be a heartbeat away” from the presidency if Donald Trump wins in November, marking the first time the Democratic ticket has gone after the former president’s age in paid media since she became the nominee, according to a Harris official.

The 50-second ad, which will target voters in battleground states, concludes with video of Trump appearing to slur his words at an event and then a Fox News host saying “the former president, he’s been off his game.” This is the first instance in which the Harris campaign has used these types of clips in any of its ads, the official said.

The Harris campaign video comes just hours before her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, is set to face off against Vance in their vice presidential nominee debate.

It features the Ohio senator’s own words, including when he said: “I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally,” comments he made on a podcast when running in 2022, and “We really need to be ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power,” a comment he made about the loss of cultural institutions by conservatives.

Throughout, there are images of “Project 2025,” a conservative think tank’s blueprint for a second Trump term, in an attempt to closely link Vance to it.

"In all of recent American history, there's always been three Presidential Debates and a VP Debate, and Trump is, as we all know, backing out of a third debate this election cycle and incredibly fidgety and non-committal with another debate against Kamala. She spun him into talking about cats and dogs getting eaten and she exposed him, on camera, as a rambling lunatic going absolutely wild, in front of billions of voters. That's perfect for the democratic party. And we want a second Harris-Trump debate because for sure, if he could swallow the bullet of one really terrible debate, he can't swallow two.

Many people and undecided voters aren't keeping up with politics, and only tune into the debates, as a means of keeping up, and some people are so overwhelmed, tuned out, clocked out, and willfully *not* following because *they don't wanna get involved*. It may very well be that something that only comes up at the verrrry end of the cycle, related or not, sways them to the polls. The only thing many Americans pay attention to are the usual four debates.

And for these people, who only watch debates? Their last impression will be this VP debate, which was very coordial, formal, polite, a bit stiff, and definitely a little impenetrable because it moved at a mile a minute - with no further debates scheduled, we're sending some people off to the polls on a bit of a confusingly dense note. It was a good debate, especially by Walz, and for sure it was heady and full of information, but, when you're batting for the swing voters, I'm not sure doubling down on hard policy is the best recipe for the moment, if it's the last and latest impression you really know your party will leave. Don't confuse, mobilize. Otherwise, the last thing some voters will see on TV is Walz and Vance patting each other on the shoulder like chums. Not a really galvanizing message.

If we want to make a great last impression on potential voters, and we only have a few windows of publicly broadcasted airtime to make solid impressions, I say we should leave these voters with the lingering sentiment that - yeah, BIG REMINDER! - If there isn't another Donald Trump debate, it's ALL because of him, and because he's a coward. Kamala agreed to another debate, most major news networks agreed to another debate, he *himself* agreed to another debate previously, when Biden was the challenger, but now that it looks like it'd hurt him - he doesn't wanna face the music. And don't you want someone who's not a coward for president?? Someone who actually *is* and can *be* a big man?

If this is truly the last debate we're getting, then we should leave voters with that same empty feeling inside and pin it entirely on Donald. Send swing voters to the booth on that knowledge alone. I would've made that my closing remark. Hell, in all this talk about the Democrats needing to fix a gender divide, have Walz, the main man leading the party, size Trump up and either expose him as weak, or, best case scenario, you get the publicity of him dipping out of that last debate so large he actually commits to another debate (and, of course, eats shit against Kamala).

"Just when you thought he couldn't really be that stupid and weird.

----article below----

JD Vance, the Republican Vice Presidential candidate, already blamed Kamala Harris for the Ram 1500 Classic’s death earlier this year. He’s now under fire for even more absurd comments made during a Senate committee hearing in March 2023. The junior U.S. Senator from Ohio said that government car seat mandates have significantly lowered the nation’s birth rate.

Vance confusingly swerved onto the topic of car seats during a hearing on airline consumer protections, according to the New York Times. We may never know precisely why Vance has a prejudice against childless women, bordering on existential fear, but we know he said:

***""One thing that I really worry about, and I think both Democrats and Republicans should worry about, is we have some real demographic problems in our country. American families aren’t having enough children. And I think there’s evidence that some of the things that we’re doing to parents is driving down the number of children that American families are having. In particular, there’s evidence that the car-seat rules that we’ve imposed — which, of course, I want kids to drive in car seats — have driven down the number of babies born in this country by over 100,000.""***

First, Vance is wrong. He claims there’s evidence to support this claim. The little evidence there is primarily points to car seats as the symptom of much larger forces at play. To paraphrase James Carville, “It’s the economy, stupid.” A 2020 research paper, “Car Seats as Contraception,” published in the Journal of Law and Economics, explored the topic. The paper crudely calculated that car seat mandates lowered the annual probability of a woman giving birth to a third child by 0.73 percent.

The takeaway should be that people aren’t having more kids because of the financial burden for the average household, not because they have to buy a car seat. Yes, the paper estimated there were 145,000 fewer births since 1980. However, loosening the laws around car seats would just kill children, as our understanding of children’s safety in cars has grown by leaps and bounds since then.

“Springfield is such a beautiful place. Have you seen what’s happened to it? It’s been overrun. You can’t do that to people. They have to be removed,” he added. “Absolutely I’d revoke [the protected status], and I’d bring them back to their country.”

The former president claimed Haiti would accept the migrants being returned to the country, which has been embroiled in turmoil, though he did not provide specifics. He has previously pledged a mass deportation effort upon taking office if he wins in November.

"The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) announced Thursday it would not endorse a candidate in this year’s presidential race, becoming the second major union to do so in recent weeks.

The IAFF executive board, which was an early backer of President Biden’s 2020 candidacy, said in a statement that its membership voted by a margin of 1.2 percentage points not to endorse a candidate in the race between Vice President Harris and former President Trump.

The union announced in April 2019, with the Democratic primary still in its early stages, that it was supporting Biden’s White House bid. The president spoke at the union’s 2023 legislative conference, where he told the firefighters in attendance, “I have your back.”

"Republicans are looking to avoid a disaster in the Nebraska Senate race amid signs that an independent candidate could be giving Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) a run for her money.

Independent Senate candidate and political newcomer Dan Osborn is challenging Fischer for her seat, betting that Nebraskans are hungry for a nonpartisan senator in a state former President Trump won by close to 20 points in 2020.

Despite Nebraska’s reliably red political leanings, the dynamics of the race have shifted in recent weeks: Republican groups have started spending in the race, and the nonpartisan election handicapper Cook Political Report last week shifted the race away from Fischer.

Osborn, who has leaned into his bio as a steamfitter who led a major strike against Kellogg’s in 2021 in Omaha, has started to pick up traction in the Nebraska Senate race.

Outside groups Retire Career Politicians PAC and Nebraska Railroaders for Public Safety have poured money into the race in support of Osborn, including at least $3.2 million from the Retire Career Politicians PAC alone, according to AdImpact. Both groups have received sizable contributions from the liberal-leaning dark money group Sixteen Thirty Fund.

Despite the fact that independent polling has largely been scarce in the Senate race, Cook Political Report’s Jessica Taylor noted last week that internal polling released by Osborn’s campaign showed the independent ahead of Fischer by 1 point.

"If today's polls are accurate that this is the best it could go, Harris is in real trouble. If there's even a little erosion of support, Harris could lose and the way Hillary Clinton lost in 2016: without warning. 

But let's compare 2016 to 2024, and look at what Harris has that Clinton didn't, and what Trump has lost but will not come back.

For Harris:

- Harris is new and interesting. She is not tarnished by reputation, false or otherwise. There are no secret mail servers, Benghazi disasters, official investigations, or crazed conspiracies about uranium or child trafficking to work against Harris.
- Complacency was rampant among Democrats about Hillary Clinton's chances of winning. This is absolutely not true now. 
- Harris had no significant challenger within the Democratic party, which is far better united behind their nominee than then. The solidarity of her support is quite similar to that of Biden's winning campaign in 2020. 
- Hillary Clinton's nomination caused great frustration and anger among Sanders's supporters, who were almost as numerous. Many did not vote.
- Climate change is in greater evidence now, and Harris sounds more realistic about it. 
- We have had only one term of Democratic incumbency, not two. Former Biden supporters are quite unlikely to turn to Trump now in the name of change,
- Recent economic signs are positive. Despite inflation, there never was a recession under Biden.
- Obamacare remains in place and is even more popular than it was  Trump is still hostile to it.
- New voters seem mostly breaking for Harris. That was not true in 2016.
- Unlike Clinton, Harris has campaigned vigorously in Blue Wall states and even in rural areas of Red states.
- More Red states than Blue indicate weakening of their majorities. (NC is the only one within striking distance of handing its electoral votes to Harris, but as whole, it is a positive sign.)
- Allan Lichtman said Trump would win in 2016, despite polls that predicted a decisive Clinton victory. He says Harris will win in 2024, despite the narrowness of her lead. Over ten elections, his prediction was wrong only in 2000, when the election had an arbitrary finish.
- Harris is 10 years younger than Clinton was. Clinton and Trump are and were only a year apart in age, and she would have been the oldest elected president ever in 2016.
- Tim Walz is generally more appealing than Tim Kane.
- Harris's husband Doug Emhoff is not a former incumbent President and does not suffer from a broken personal reputation.
-  Hillary Clinton could not loosen herself from the albatross of Bill Clinton's flaws. Perhaps Joe Biden is more of a weight on Harris than she wants, but she is far less encumbered by his lack of popularity than Hillary Clinton was by her husband's.
- Kamala Harris is prettier and sexier than Hillary Clinton. Maybe that should not matter, but it does.

Against Trump:

- Trump is damaged by his reputation as president, including January 6th, his poor response to the pandemic, and two impeachments.
- Project 2025 is too scary for most.
- Trump's lies are easy to spot and egregious, and the media now call him out.  They were not doing so in 2016.
- Opponents within the Republican party are louder and more powerful.
- The religious right has lost ground and is not as accommodating of Trump as it was. 
- Though Georgia and Arizona, won by Biden in 2020, seem to be trending back toward slight Republican majorities, they remain in play for Harris. Clinton did not have any hope for either state in 2016. 
- Trump is even less coherent and more unhinged than he was.
- The Trump campaign was blindsided and unprepared for Harris's candidacy. He is elderly now, in poor health, and is 20 years older than his energetic opponent.

Summary:

Although we could make a list for Trump that would put him in a stronger place than in 2020, it does not stand out from the above.  A Trump surge late in this election cycle would truly be a bad sign for Harris, but this does not seem nearly as likely as it was.

All in all, I am more confident of a Harris victory than I was for the same of Hillary Clinton, who I was fairly sure would lose all along. That said, anything can happen.  Complacency is not acceptable if you support Harris. 

Get out there and help.",1728304315,1,democrats,:snoo_putback: Opinion,Observations: 2016 vs. 2024,"Observations: 2016 vs. 2024 If today's polls are accurate that this is the best it could go, Harris is in real trouble. If there's even a little erosion of support, Harris could lose and the way Hillary Clinton lost in 2016: without warning. 

But let's compare 2016 to 2024, and look at what Harris has that Clinton didn't, and what Trump has lost but will not come back.

For Harris:

- Harris is new and interesting. She is not tarnished by reputation, false or otherwise. There are no secret mail servers, Benghazi disasters, official investigations, or crazed conspiracies about uranium or child trafficking to work against Harris.
- Complacency was rampant among Democrats about Hillary Clinton's chances of winning. This is absolutely not true now. 
- Harris had no significant challenger within the Democratic party, which is far better united behind their nominee than then. The solidarity of her support is quite similar to that of Biden's winning campaign in 2020. 
- Hillary Clinton's nomination caused great frustration and anger among Sanders's supporters, who were almost as numerous. Many did not vote.
- Climate change is in greater evidence now, and Harris sounds more realistic about it. 
- We have had only one term of Democratic incumbency, not two. Former Biden supporters are quite unlikely to turn to Trump now in the name of change,
- Recent economic signs are positive. Despite inflation, there never was a recession under Biden.
- Obamacare remains in place and is even more popular than it was  Trump is still hostile to it.
- New voters seem mostly breaking for Harris. That was not true in 2016.
- Unlike Clinton, Harris has campaigned vigorously in Blue Wall states and even in rural areas of Red states.
- More Red states than Blue indicate weakening of their majorities. (NC is the only one within striking distance of handing its electoral votes to Harris, but as whole, it is a positive sign.)
- Allan Lichtman said Trump would win in 2016, despite polls that predicted a decisive Clinton victory. He says Harris will win in 2024, despite the narrowness of her lead. Over ten elections, his prediction was wrong only in 2000, when the election had an arbitrary finish.
- Harris is 10 years younger than Clinton was. Clinton and Trump are and were only a year apart in age, and she would have been the oldest elected president ever in 2016.
- Tim Walz is generally more appealing than Tim Kane.
- Harris's husband Doug Emhoff is not a former incumbent President and does not suffer from a broken personal reputation.
-  Hillary Clinton could not loosen herself from the albatross of Bill Clinton's flaws. Perhaps Joe Biden is more of a weight on Harris than she wants, but she is far less encumbered by his lack of popularity than Hillary Clinton was by her husband's.
- Kamala Harris is prettier and sexier than Hillary Clinton. Maybe that should not matter, but it does.

Against Trump:

- Trump is damaged by his reputation as president, including January 6th, his poor response to the pandemic, and two impeachments.
- Project 2025 is too scary for most.
- Trump's lies are easy to spot and egregious, and the media now call him out.  They were not doing so in 2016.
- Opponents within the Republican party are louder and more powerful.
- The religious right has lost ground and is not as accommodating of Trump as it was. 
- Though Georgia and Arizona, won by Biden in 2020, seem to be trending back toward slight Republican majorities, they remain in play for Harris. Clinton did not have any hope for either state in 2016. 
- Trump is even less coherent and more unhinged than he was.
- The Trump campaign was blindsided and unprepared for Harris's candidacy. He is elderly now, in poor health, and is 20 years older than his energetic opponent.

Summary:

Although we could make a list for Trump that would put him in a stronger place than in 2020, it does not stand out from the above.  A Trump surge late in this election cycle would truly be a bad sign for Harris, but this does not seem nearly as likely as it was.

All in all, I am more confident of a Harris victory than I was for the same of Hillary Clinton, who I was fairly sure would lose all along. That said, anything can happen.  Complacency is not acceptable if you support Harris.

🤗I voted for 💙 Madam President Kamala Harris 
& Vice President Tim Walz 💙 of course! Also YES on Issue 1, of course! I voted for all the democrats I could choose. Unfortunately, in Ohio, there were quite a few positions that had republican options only. 😔 I hope that changes in Ohio 💙 soon. 

The parking lot was practically full, and a bunch of people there to vote, but there wasn’t a wait. It was quite a long walk for the voting process considering I’m very ill. However, I wanted my vote to count and in a deep red area I wasn’t trusting this maga republican controlled area with my absentee ballot. 

A woman asked me if I’d like to sit down, I said yes please just for a moment. I didn’t realize she meant to vote. Which sounds lovely until you realize you have no privacy. I mean absolutely no privacy at all! I probably should have said umm no thanks 🙂‍↔️, but I was embarrassed enough (that’s a personal issue about my health, age & disability). If I had an issue I could quite easily raise my hand, reach out & touch any one of the multiple poll workers, or whisper for help they were so close. 😕 The poll workers looking at how I’m voting, repeatedly. 👀 Every person walking around the line for a voting station could easily read my screen/vote selection. 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

But, even the standing vote area was lacking privacy. There was a partition, yet it didn’t really keep anything private. I don’t know why they don’t do the booths with the curtains anymore?! Luckily I was able to snatch my printed vote selections before the poll worker did, and reassured them I’ve got it from here thanks. 

😊 At least scanning my ballot went better this year.  This guy didn’t insist on taking it, reading it or putting it in the machine. He reassured me it can go in just about any way I wanted. Upside down and top end first. The machine didn’t show my selections. Only that my ballot was counted. Shew, yay!!! 😄 

A very nice cop at the entrance was welcoming and holding the door. As I left, I thanked him again, wished him a good day. He went on a bit, kindly. Then I said I hope they bring you lunch soon! Then he mentioned McDonald’s. I replied well it’s all American with a laugh. He said yeah I don’t eat any foreign foods! 😧 He was dead serious. 🥴 I replied I like a lot of foreign foods, but yeah everyone knows McDonald’s from birth. 😬 ha ha 😕 🤔 I’m thinking really, that’s how crazy this has gotten?! 😔

I’m glad I voted 🗳️ Hopefully they don’t pull any shenanigans with my vote. And I pray we pull through this election.

"My Journey from the Green Party to the Working Families Party

From 2020 to 2023, I was deeply involved with the Ohio Green Party. I stood by the Green Party’s platform, which emphasized grassroots democracy, ecological wisdom, social justice, and peace. I believed strongly in their commitment to progressive policies, and I proudly voted for Howie Hawkins in 2020. I also supported local Ohio Green Party candidates during the 2021 elections, believing that the party’s unique platform was essential for pushing the political conversation forward.

However, in 2023, I made the difficult decision to leave the Green Party and join the Working Families Party (WFP). When I heard Jill Stein was considering another presidential run, I became concerned. Her previous runs were divisive, and I believed that her candidacy would once again negatively impact the Green Party’s growth and influence. I wanted to continue working with a party that would drive progressive policies without playing the role of a spoiler in our broken electoral system.

That’s why the WFP appealed to me. Unlike the Green Party, the WFP doesn’t run their own presidential candidates. Instead, they focus on electing progressive Democrats by running primary challengers against establishment candidates. And when these candidates win their primaries, WFP uses fusion voting (where legal) to prevent the spoiler effect by running on their own party line alongside the Democratic ticket. This strategy allows for the building of independent power without handing victories to Republicans.

I believe that the U.S. political system would benefit greatly from having more competitive political parties. To truly achieve this, we need to abolish the electoral college, which hinders a healthy, competitive political landscape. If Jill Stein hadn’t announced her candidacy in 2023, I would likely still be with the Green Party today, as I fundamentally believe in their values. But I’ve found that the WFP offers a pragmatic approach to advancing progressive policies within our current political reality.

For now, I’m supporting Democratic candidates up and down the ballot in this election year, especially with the importance of defeating Trump. However, if Trump is defeated, I’ll return my focus to advocating for the abolition of the electoral college and continuing to support progressive Democrats, social democratic Democrats, and Working Families Party candidates in future elections. 

Living in Springfield, Ohio, I’ve seen firsthand how Trump’s lies and the violent rhetoric he has fueled have affected my community. His influence here has driven me to volunteer, donate, and vote for Kamala Harris. While Springfield isn’t the only reason, it is certainly one of the main drivers in my commitment to ensuring his defeat and pushing for real progressive change via voting for Kamala Harris.",1728499493,101,democrats,:snoo_feelsgoodman: Discussion :snoo_thoughtful:,My Journey from the Green Party to the Working Families Party and Democratic Party. ,"My Journey from the Green Party to the Working Families Party and Democratic Party.

"Vice President Harris announced Friday she would create a bipartisan council of advisers if elected president, in an effort to reach out to Republican and independent voters while in Arizona.

“Not only will I have a Republican in my Cabinet, but I’m also going to — I was talking to my team about it — I want to create some structure around the following. Which is, I love good ideas, wherever they come from, I love good ideas,” Harris said.

She added, “part of what I intend to do … is creating a bipartisan council of advisers who can then give feedback on policy as we go forward.”

During her campaign remarks in Scottsdale, in front of a banner that read “Country Over Party,” she added that she doesn’t want “yes people” around her.

She previously has said she would appoint a Republican to a future Cabinet, which she repeated on “The View” this week as an example of something she would do differently than President Biden.

**How One Polling Decision Is Leading to Two Distinct Stories of the Election**

*A methodological choice has created divergent paths of polling results. Is this election more like 2020 or 2022?*

*By Nate Cohn
Oct. 6, 2024. Updated 12:56 p.m. ET*

Over the last month, one methodological decision seems to have produced two parallel universes of political polling.

In one universe, Kamala Harris leads only narrowly in the national popular vote against Donald J. Trump, even as she holds a discernible edge in the Northern battlegrounds. The numbers look surprisingly similar to the 2022 midterm election.

In the other, Ms. Harris has a clear lead in the national vote, but the battlegrounds are very tight. It’s essentially a repeat of the 2020 election.

This divide is almost entirely explained by whether a pollster uses “weighting on recalled vote,” which means trying to account for how voters say they voted in the last election.

Here’s how it works. First, the pollster asks respondents whether they voted for Joe Biden or Mr. Trump in the last election. Then they use a statistical technique called weighting, in which pollsters give more or less “weight” to respondents from different demographic groups, such that each group represents its actual share of the population. In this case, the pollster weights the number of Biden ’20 or Trump ’20 voters to match the outcome of the last election.

This approach had long been considered a mistake. For reasons we’ll explain, pollsters have avoided it over the years. But they increasingly do it today, partly as a way to try to make sure they have enough Trump supporters after high-profile polling misfires in 2016 and 2020. The choice has become an important fault line among pollsters in this election, and it helps explain the whiplash that poll watchers are experiencing from day to day.

Over the last month, about two-thirds of polls were weighted by recalled vote.

An important — and perhaps obvious — consequence of weighting by recalled vote is that it makes poll results look more like the 2020 election results. The polls that don’t do it, including New York Times/Siena College surveys, are more likely to show clear changes from four years ago.

While the differences between the two sets of polls are relatively small, they add up to two different stories of the election. The polls that don’t weight on past vote tend to show results that align more closely with the result of the 2022 midterm election than the last presidential election. They also show that Mr. Trump’s advantage in the Electoral College, with respect to the popular vote, has dwindled over the last four years. The polls weighted on past vote, on the other hand, show little more than a 2020 repeat

As we’ll see, this is a fraught decision for pollsters. On one hand, weighting on recalled vote would have produced worse results in every presidential election from 2004 to 2020. On the other, it’s the choice that might save pollsters from underestimating Mr. Trump yet again.

**Why this kind of weighting is controversial**

When I started following polling methodology debates 20 years ago, weighting on recalled vote was considered a very bad idea. A surprising number of respondents don’t remember how they voted; they seem likelier to remember voting for the winner; and they sometimes report voting when voting records show they did not.

This pattern has persisted all the way from the first time I read about recall vote all the way to the present, based on data archived at the Roper Center and 2021-24 data from the Pew Research Center and Times/Siena. The same pattern shows up in the exit polls in every presidential election year when it was asked (2004, 2008, 2020).

The tendency for recall vote to overstate the winner of the last electionmeans that weighting on recall vote has a predictable effect: It increases support for the party that lost the last election.

While polls have a lot of issues, underestimating the party that lost the last election doesn’t turn out to be one of them. As a result, weighting on recalled vote would have made the polls less accurate in every election since 2004 (the farthest back considered), based on a re-analysis of 70 polls archived at the Roper Center.

The effect of recall vote in 2020 is especially revealing: The polls that year were so poor that there are individual cases where recall-vote weighting would have helped. For example, it would have produced a smaller lead for Mr. Biden in ABC/Washington Post’s infamous poll showing him leading by 17 points in Wisconsin in October 2020. But it wouldn’t have fixed it, either; by our estimate, it would have still shown Mr. Biden up 12 if recall vote had been used when producing the result. And it would have made most other 2020 polls less accurate, on average, including Times/Siena polls and most of the other ABC/Post polls.

What does it mean if recall vote wouldn’t have been enough to fix the polls four years ago? The most straightforward interpretation: For the 2020 polls to be right, pollsters needed the 2016 recall vote to look “wrong.” The polls needed Mr. Trump to hold a clear lead on recall vote — exactly what one would have expected historically, given the tendency for recall vote to overstate the winner of the previous election.

As a result, recalled vote didn’t even help the polls in the biggest polling misfire in 40 years.

**Why pollsters now weight on recall vote**

Despite that record, many pollsters have decided to weight on recall vote for four main reasons.

First, many pollsters believe recall vote is more reliable than it used to be. Whether it’s accurate enough is another question, but it’s certainly true that recall vote looks “closer” to the last election result than in prior cycles. The last three years of Times/Siena and Pew Research NPORS data show about a three-point gap between recalled 2020 vote and the actual 2020 result, a far cry from the double-digit differences a decade or two ago.

Why could recall vote be getting more accurate? One possibility is that poll respondents have become more likely to remember whom they voted for in the last election, thanks to rising political engagement and polarization. Another possibility is that data collected online may be less vulnerable to whatever it is that causes the “winner bias” (importantly, almost all the reanalyzed polls — where we produced estimates of what a poll’s result might be if it had used recall-vote weighting — were telephone surveys).

This election also features a novel case: The loser of the last election is running again (and most Republicans don’t even believe he lost), and the winner of the last election just lost a rematch, in a sense, against that loser. It’s anyone’s guess how all of this affects the accuracy of recall vote, but it is easy to imagine further mitigation of the traditional “winner bias.”

Second, some pollsters use panels of repeat survey-takers, which means they have responses from them over a long period. A pollster may have asked panelists in 2020 how they voted, as opposed to asking them today to remember how they voted four years ago. This counts as weighting on past vote, but it’s not quite the same as someone’s recalled vote. This approach ought to be less vulnerable to the biases in recall-vote weighting, even if there are still challenges involved — like what to do about any new panelists or changes in the makeup of the electorate since 2020.

Third, recall vote can be used to bludgeon self-evidently unrepresentative data toward a more plausible result. This is especially useful for survey designs with no plausible case for validity, like a poll of people from a single social media platform. No one expects such an approach to yield a good sample, but recall-vote weighting can quickly get it into the ballpark. Indeed, more than 80 percent of opt-in online panel polls weight on recall vote, while other kinds of polls are less likely to do so.

Fourth, recall vote is being used to help address the tendency for polls to understate Mr. Trump’s strength over the last eight years.

As mentioned earlier, weighting on recall vote historically helps the candidate who lost the last election. This year, that’s Mr. Trump.

Of course, the recall-vote-weighted poll results here represent an entirely plausible outcome. If the polls underestimate Mr. Trump, as they did four or eight years ago, November’s results might look exactly like this. But historically, it’s not surprising that weighting on recall vote would help Republicans: Mr. Trump lost the last election; as such, weighting on recall vote would be expected to give more weight to Trump ’20 voters, and therefore to Mr. Trump today.

When big-name traditional pollsters weight by recall vote, this is usually the reason. Some of these pollsters think it’s a perfectly valid measure, but many only use it grudgingly. They still more or less believe the old arguments against recall vote, but they choose to employ it anyway. They wouldn’t be doing it if they trusted their data to produce unbiased results, and they wouldn’t be doing it if it didn’t shift their polls toward Mr. Trump.

As Patrick Murray of the Monmouth poll put it in explaining his decision to weight on recall vote, “The Trump phenomenon is sui generis, and you have to pick your poison.”

**Did recall vote fix past problems?**

There is some good news contained in this story: Recall-vote weighting is almost certainly reducing the risk that the polls systematically underestimate Mr. Trump, as they did in 2016 or 2020. As we’ve shown, it has given many pollsters a quick and easy fix to move their numbers toward the right.

Many of the worst survey results of the 2020 election seem unlikely to be repeated this time around. For instance, The Washington Post and CNN/SSRS state polls now weight by recall vote, which means we won’t be seeing any results like Biden +17 in Wisconsin or Biden +16 nationwide.

But there’s a strange contradiction between the two major observations so far — and the contradiction points toward real trade-offs involving recall-vote weighting.

On the one hand, many pollsters are weighting on recall vote because it yields more Republican-leaning results.

On the other, the polls weighted like this aren’t necessarily producing especially Republican-leaning results. They don’t look like the hypothetical recall-weighted Times/Siena polls, for instance. Instead, they’re producing results neatly in line with the result of the 2020 election.

How is that possible? There are two basic possibilities.

One is that the polls weighted on recall vote are full of highly engaged voters who haven’t shifted since 2020, and therefore weighting on recall vote will produce a 2020 repeat.

Another possibility: It may be employed selectively by pollsters concerned their data is too far to the left. The two theories could be connected, as highly engaged voters have leaned left during the Trump era. Weighting on recall vote, then, would move a group of relatively Democratic-leaning samples neatly in line with the 2020 election result.

Whatever the explanation, this tension suggests significant trade-offs as pollsters weight on recall vote. Most obviously, it may make it harder to identify any changes since the last election. One reason is simply because recall-vote weighting mechanically forces polls toward the last election result. But even deeper than that, the technique is being used, at least in part, because pollsters don’t trust their survey results. It’s an attitude that can lead pollsters to treat surprising and unusual data as suspicious, rather than potentially newsworthy or insightful. This is understandable: I know I don’t always trust our survey results after the last decade of polling misfires. But when legitimate concern about polling morphs into weighting away otherwise outlying findings, it risks squelching any indication of anything that might be out of the ordinary.

In a way, the problem is reminiscent of something called “herding,” in which pollsters tweak their surveys to bring their results into alignment with the average of other polls. Like herding, the decision to weight on past vote is often a reflection of how pollsters feel about the quality of their underlying data. In this case, however, pollsters aren’t necessarily herding toward what other pollsters say. Instead, they’re essentially herding toward the result of the last presidential election.

A near repeat of the last presidential election is certainly a plausible outcome. In today’s polarized era, who could possibly be surprised by a repeat in Mr. Trump’s third presidential run? If it’s a near repeat, the polls weighted by recall vote won’t just have an excellent night themselves, but they might also spare the entire industry another four years of misery.

But if this election is different, in any direction, this year’s polls might not be able to see it coming.",1728738341,0,democrats,Polling Analysis,How One Polling Decision Is Leading to Two Distinct Stories of the Election,"How One Polling Decision Is Leading to Two Distinct Stories of the Election (*This is from Nate Cohn's subscribers-only website.)*

"Vice President Harris is blitzing through the states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan this week, as polls tighten and Democratic nerves fray over the possibility they could again lose the “blue wall” to former President Trump.

Harris in the next six days will spend three days in Michigan, two days in Pennsylvania and a day in Wisconsin with multiple stops on each visit.

Harris has hopes of building a second path to 270 electoral votes that would include victories in other swing states such as Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona. But she trails Trump in the RealClearPolitics average in those states, all of which have generally been won by GOP presidential candidates over the last few decades.

The blue wall blitz by Harris shows she does not want to make a mistake some said Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton made in 2016 by not spending enough time campaigning in the three states.

Harris is also showing a willingness to take more risks. It was announced Monday that she will sit down for an interview with Fox News’s Bret Baier on Wednesday.

"Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign laid out what it sees as her path to victory in Pennsylvania in a memo shared exclusively with NBC News ahead of Monday night’s rally in bellwether Erie County.

The Harris team pointed to polls showing Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, having made gains in the battleground state’s suburbs — which it dubbed “our own mini ‘blue wall’” in Pennsylvania — compared with President Joe Biden’s 2020 performance there.

The campaign also emphasized that a win involves boosting its popularity among educated suburbanites, including those who have voted for Republicans in recent elections. Nearly 160,000 voters in the state cast ballots for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential primary this year — with her numbers proving stronger among suburban voters — even after she had already dropped out of the race against former President Donald Trump.

The campaign cited surveys last month from The Philadelphia Inquirer/The New York Times/Siena College and Marist College that both showed Harris up 6 percentage points over Trump in the suburbs — a notable improvement from Trump’s 3-point victory over Biden among suburban Pennsylvanians in 2020, as exit polls showed. (The results in both of the surveys last month fell within their margins of error.)

The campaign highlighted events that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have held in red counties like Johnstown, Lancaster and Rochester. It also detailed investments made in red parts of the state to “cut margins and stop Trump’s only hope of victory,” noting that 16 of its 50 statewide campaign offices are in counties Trump won by more than 10 points in 2020.

The campaign highlighted that as of Sunday it had knocked on more than 1 million doors across the state, including 250,000 over the weekend, since Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket. It also referred to its 50 offices and 450 on-the-ground staff members.",1728954951,61,democrats,:snoo: Article ,Harris campaign sees its path to victory in Pennsylvania running through the suburbs,"Harris campaign sees its path to victory in Pennsylvania running through the suburbs Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign laid out what it sees as her path to victory in Pennsylvania in a memo shared exclusively with NBC News ahead of Monday night’s rally in bellwether Erie County.

*We* might have been able to avoid the worst of it.

And the Trump administration *disbanded* that team, calling it ""government bloat"" and got rid of some people, absorbed some of the others into jobs that ""at least still had things to do with pandemic response"". 

Trump *disbanded the team*, and then decided to *ignore* the playbook that had been created and just do whatever he wanted 

- which included downplaying the danger of the pandemic, acting to Americans like ""it'll be over soon"" and like he had it well in hand, discouraging thousands from getting vaccines or social distancing or wearing masks, and spreading disinformation claiming vaccines spreading autism, while he sent *our* covid tests and ventilators, plus a 5.6 milliion Coronavirus Aid Package, *to our enemy Russia*

The pandemic wouldn't have gotten as bad as it had, it wouldn't have killed off more people in America than other countries, we wouldn't have had over 111,000 Americans die, 

we might have *avoided* the pandemic getting so bad in the US it tanked our economy, and led to the inflation and raised grocery prices that everyone complains about, 

had Trump not prioritized his ego over American lives.

So, if anyone wants to blame someone for the pandemic bringing our grocery prices so high, *blame the person whose actions led it.*

"Like a beat-up old jalopy, the right-wing outrage mobile keeps backfiring. Every time they step on the gas, it has the opposite intended effect, also known as the Streisand Effect. And it seems like the Harris-Walz campaign and Democrats are capitalizing on this phenomenon by using every right-wing distraction as a guide for their own messaging.

Examples of backfiring messages include: Fox News deceptively editing President Biden’s comment about threats of election day violence, which only focused attention on the January 6th insurrectionists; Jill Stein got her name on the ballot in Wisconsin, where Biden won in 2020, only to remind everyone that her 2016 third-party candidacy sabotaged Hillary Clinton’s election; Trump’s unhinged rally speeches have only magnified his fourth-grade speaking abilities, his racist obsession with genetics, and his lack of understanding how anything works.

And Democrats have been optimizing these distractions and bombshells. One shocking revelation from the new book by Bob Woodward that Trump shipped COVID testing equipment to Vladimir Putin, which Russia then corroborated, has been widely reported. Also, news that Trump and dozens of republicans were endorsed by a right-wing trophy hunting group that targets adorable pigmy hippos like the famous Moo Deng, has been making the rounds.

Democrats aren’t just boosting damaging bombshells. They are also highlighting the duds. The dockworkers strike that caused momentary panic about supply chain interruptions before the holidays – which was supposed to be Trump’s October surprise – ended after only two days, and made Biden look like a champion of unionized labor.

Democrats have also taken a creative approach to messaging. FEMA added a “Hurricane Rumor Response” page to their website telling the truth about FEMA’s heroic handling of the hurricanes. And Kamala Harris spoke directly to the Weather Channel’s 1.17 million subscribers.

Let’s not forget law enforcement. The FBI thwarted a planned election-day terrorist attack, sending two resounding messages: The intelligence community is keeping voters safe; and anyone planning terrorist attacks is under surveillance and will be caught.

"While watching the Kamala Harris interview on Fox News, I found my wondering why the democrats haven’t formulated better talking points on key issues for voters.

For example, when Bret Baier asked Harris why the overwhelming majority of Americans believe Trump is stronger on the economy, she could  have used this as an opportunity to correct the Republican narrative/rhetoric.

Instead of dancing around the question and trying to highlight other issues with Trump, I believe there’s a strong fact-based approach that should, if properly executed, land well with voters.

Here’s how I would answer the question: 

• Start by pointing out the obvious: (1) in 2020,  the entire world experienced a global pandemic, which hospitalized millions, caused numerous industries to come to halt, and shutdown major global supply chains, and (2) in 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, which, in addition to being a wholly unjust invasion of a foreign country, caused dramatic effects on the price of oil.

• admit that it prices have increased and that you understand how hard that is for nearly all Americans.

• point out that Trump was only President for the very beginning of Covid and certainly was not around when global economies started feeling the effects of the pandemic.

• make it very well known that the “bad economy” was not a uniquely American issue. Explain that virtually every major economy around the world experienced rising inflation (point to cold hard facts).

• explain that inflation in the U.S. rose slower and cooled quicker than many major nations, especially compared to nations that conservatives seem to love (i.e., Hungary).

• credit this to Biden, the Federal Reserve, and American ingenuity. 

• Offer someone to blame. If this was a uniquely American issue then by all means blame democrats. But it wasn’t. It also wasn’t a progressive liberal issue, point to high inflation in conservative run countries. We had a bad economy because of factors outside of our control and we should be thankful that the Biden administration got us through quicker and with less pain than the vast majority of countries around the world.

• finally, I would close with offering an answer to the underlying question about why Americans feel that Trump is better on the economy. It’s human nature to want to credit good times to our Presidents and in many cases you should. But the facts are different here, and it’s networks like this (Fox News) that are misleading Americans by acting like Biden is to blame for higher inflation. When in reality he should be thanked for preventing inflation from getting out of control.

It’s a strategy, described by several top campaign aides, with massive implications for the shape of the electorate. Between Harris’ push on abortion and Trump’s growth with male voters — especially young men — pollsters on both sides of the aisle are predicting that 2024 will represent the largest chasm in vote preferences between the two sexes in modern political history.

There’s evidence from 2022 to back up the Harris campaign’s theory that she can improve her margins with women. Nationally, Democrats won women by 53 percent to Republicans’ 45 percent. But in Michigan, where abortion played a central role not only in the governor’s race but in a ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won women by 62 percent — a 26-point gap over Republican Tudor Dixon.

So far, Harris is on track to expand those margins. An October New York Times/Siena College national poll found Harris winning 56 percent of the vote among women, with Trump earning just 40 percent — a 16-point gap. And in 2020, Trump won two-thirds of white women without a college degree, a 27-point gap with Biden, according to exit polls. But Harris, according to a recent Marist College poll, has cut that advantage in half.

Democrats aren’t abandoning efforts to target men in this final stretch, but the Harris campaign’s strategy is designed to shore up support among moderate women who have long been the last-minute deciders in a tight presidential race. White women make up the largest percentage of the vote share — at 38 percent nationally and 42 percent or more in priority states — according to an analysis from Galvanize Action, a nonpartisan group that’s been surveying more than 6,000 white women across 10 battleground states since June.

The Harris campaign is touting a list of endorsements from more than 70 tribal leaders across Indian Country; roughly a fourth of them are from Arizona.


So far, at least 17 elected officials from nearly half of the state’s 22 federally recognized tribes have personally backed the Harris-Walz ticket, both publicly and privately to the campaign, but not on behalf of their governments.


These include representatives from the Navajo Nation, Tohono O’odham Nation, Colorado River Indian Tribes, Gila River Indian Community, Kaibab Paiute Tribe, San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe, Ak-Chin Indian Community, Pueblo of Zuni, Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community and San Carlos Apache Tribe.

"Over the past two decades, Republicans have consolidated a near monopoly in the Great Plains, a shift across a stretch of prairie once dominated by Democrats that could become complete in November if Senator Jon Tester of Montana loses his seat.

But this year, Nebraska has thrown Republicans for a loop. Mr. Osborn’s dark-horse, grass-roots campaign has transformed what was expected to be a sleepy race into a late-breaking and high-stakes clash that has forced Ms. Fischer and her allies to invest millions of dollars to avoid an upset.

The result has been an influx of cash into Mr. Bacon’s increasingly liberal district, leaving him in an uphill fight for political survival.

In the Senate contest, Mr. Osborn is tapping into a well of discontent with Congress and leaning on his status as a political newcomer and his background as a union laborer to appeal to working-class voters from across the political spectrum.

"Following Kamala Harris’ town hall in Delaware County Wednesday, some of the undecided voters told CNN’s John King they made up their mind to back the vice president against former President Donald Trump.

“If I had to pick right now, I would pick her,” said Lauren Holden, who said she voted for Trump in 2020.

King spoke with Holden and four other undecided voters from Pennsylvania who asked Harris a question during Wednesday’s event. Three of the five told the veteran CNN anchor and election analyst they had decided to back Harris. Every vote is important in Pennsylvania, where Harris and Trump are virtually tied in recent polls.

Harris’ response to a question to name a personal weakness — that she has always leaned on a team of “smart people” — resonated with Erik Svendsen, an IT worker in Conshohocken who is registered as a Libertarian. Svendsen told King he came into the town hall undecided, but would now vote for the vice president.

While Thistle remains undecided, she told King she came out of the town hall feeling personal “adoration” for Harris, especially when the vice president made a point to speak to her following the event.

CNN offered to host a town hall event for Trump, but he declined to participate. The network initially proposed a second debate, scheduled for Wednesday.

"An appeal to America: A message to all citizens from a person with Autism


An Special Letter to the Editor Written By Christopher C. Gagliardi

To most importantly the undecided voters,
This is a message that I asked to be not edited nor toned down. This is something I had to write because I had felt the deep urgency to write to the press about. In less than 11 days from today, the nation's future will be decided upon by you...the people of this country. But already as we speak, many have already made their decision and the uncertainty of this has me greatly worried, and with good reason. I would like to tell you a important story as to why your vote and your voice matters to me and to others. I am a 43-year-old male loving life to the fullest, enjoying everything that makes America a place that I love very much. 

I may look normal today, but forty - three years ago, I was born with a challenge called “infantile autism.” At that time, no one really understood autism, and my frequent “tantrums,” aloof affect, and inability to speak baffled the people around me. I felt like a caged animal. I was frustrated because I lacked the ability to explain my thoughts and feelings, and simultaneously oblivious to the fact that was I unable to communicate. You see, Autism can be lonely, especially early on.

I was the only one who knew how hard it was to be autistic, because I lived it and felt that no one could understand me or my experience. My hometown didn’t have the correct special education programs for autistic or other special needs children, so I was bussed out to other public schools in neighboring school districts, which presented it’s own challenges. Among the challenges that people who are on the spectrum deal with every day, there was transitioning from a home and small-town environment to a new larger environment and school system. Another thing that is difficult sometimes for People with special needs is that they are expected to acclimate, even in school, to common-place daily events like holiday celebrations, decorating the classrooms, and other activities. Yet as a person with this kind of challenge with no steps to help me transition, to me, this was torturous and painful. In addition, there is the horrific and painful reality of bullying. I was called names, called “retarded,” and subjected to physical violence, but my language abilities were not yet available to me and I didn’t have the capacity to tell my mom what was happening. Soon I was developing my ability to speak, and as my physical ability grew so did my desire to speak out to support rights for those who needed them. 

My confidence grew and I was fortunate to have the warmth and endless support of people who believed in me then and still believe in me now. The result has been a lifetime of breakthroughs: allowing my mom to hug me for the first time at sixteen-years-old after a bad encounter with bullying; a little acting, and some music; working as a community activist seeking to deliver a message about the rights of people with special needs; running for and winning roles in high school government up to and including student council president; and even taking a chance on college although there is still a need to fully address correct transitional programs for those with special needs seeking to move into a collegiate setting. In 2005, because of my work as a community activist, I was honored by my political peers as a hero among Bergen County’s residents. I did these things by transforming “the impossible into the possible,” and by refusing to surrender or listen to negativity. I accomplished these goals with the faith, love, and support of every single individual on my side that I was blessed to have surrounding along my entire journey.

Their love and support lead to my decision that I would dedicate my life to fighting for change through politics and to bring attention to the issues that affect citizens with special needs. I have been fortunate enough to have been in the political game since I was, believe it or not, 12 years of age. I've made phone calls and campaigned for candidates. Whether at the grassroots level, by getting out the vote with phone banks, or deciding to run for New Jersey State Assembly in the 37th legislative district. You read that correctly. At the time, I was concerned that no one could truly represent the physically and mentally challenged citizens of our state. I educated myself on how to get onto the ballot, took the train with my petition and signatures to Trenton, New Jersey, and filed. My platform was simple: I was and still am for change in this country, a country I love so deeply. My attempt at a run for elected office got attention in media outlets and the story reached as far as the northwestern United States. In the summer of 2009, I won 15% in the primaries for my race. My opponents were so impressed that they appointed me the first Special Needs Outreach Advocate. 

All my life I can say that I am proud of the liberties that have been afforded to me and I take seriously the solemn responsibility of protecting them. Which is why I must now use this word: INCLUSION. Inclusion means to eradicate the exclusion of physically and mentally challenged people who cannot enjoy a normal life in school or society. And I will tell you that Exclusion or denial of someone's right to live a happy life especially here in this great country is WRONG. In my life, whenever I had doubts about my abilities or felt like I had failed, my dear friend and mentor Peter Noonan always told me: “You create your own destiny!”
This leads me to the point of my letter and why this important election effects not just me, but millions of people with special needs in our country. 

As I said earlier I was born with Infantile Autism. I have been fortunate enough to have been in the political game since I was, believe it or not, 12 years of age. I've made phone calls and campaigned for candidates. I ran for the state assembly and helped eradicate the R word from the language in our state and also to make the toughest Anti-Bullying bill of rights. Why can I say all these things, it is because I can say that I was NEVER EVER scared of doing these things. Until Now.

I can honestly admit that for as long as I can remember, I can not recall a time in the history of this country or in the history of the 21st century had I ever seen a election where the very future of our country and all that we have so fought hard for, especially our rights as a person with special needs, is at stake in this election. In the year 2016 I was in absolute SHOCK when I watched Donald J. Trump mock a reporter with special needs during one of his campaign stops in the last presidential election. When you attack and mock someone with special needs, it is not only a violation of their rights, but of every single citizen with special needs and their families, period. As a person with special needs, I have a great fear for people with special needs and for others that if I woke tomorrow and heard the results that could be one of the greatest tragedies in our modern times.

I am frightened by the prospect that people cannot get to the voting poll, because of the current crisis we are facing, where the ballots are going and a president that will show a lack of care, compassion, taking care of people, sitting in the white house for another 4 years continuing to abuse the very office the people vote to give him.

Donald Trump, DOES NOT represent America. The only thing that he represents is the almighty dollar, and when he looks out at his supporters and constituents, all he sees is money in his pocket. The hardship and struggle that people have endured for so long in silence due to bullying, because of traits that we were born with should not hold us back from what we can achieve and contribute to social progress. My brothers and sisters, and fellow Americans who are reading this letter, I am crying out from the mountaintop and declare with a roar on behalf of all people with special needs that “I am a human being. My life has value. My freedom I do not take lightly.” 

All that my mom and I fought for is something we cherish deeply and yet he does not see us as American citizens trying to show the world that people with special needs can DO and ACCOMPLISH greatness! It is the fear Donald Trump used to make us feel small, unappreciated and worse. I cannot and will not allow such a travesty of injustice to be done, not just to those who struggle with special needs day after day, but to women, LGBTQPIA citizens, and citizens of every faith, nationality, and creed. They all should be given the same historic opportunities that this nation has given to me. This election provided those citizens with a candidate who encompassed courage, compassion, grace, dignity and more throughout her entire life, and that has gone above and beyond the call of duty in fighting for every single individual’s god-given potential.

To the people who are undecided, hear me. There is only ONE candidate who can stand up and help bring our country back from the brink of the abyss, someone who has a great understanding of us, as individuals, as AMERICANS indeed, no matter what preference of gender, religion, nationality, etc. and he too, like me, has a challenge that he fought so hard for, her name? Kamala Harris.She has a record that is bar none extraordinary and the obstacles and hardships he has faced in HER life is a living testament to her service in the senate and as President Joe Biden  Vice President for 4 years clearly shows she is ready to lead our country to build America better, stronger, brighter, hope-filled and true to the words of our constitution to make our country: “A more perfect union”. 

Time and again she has proven herself to be the most qualified candidate to run for the presidency maybe ever. From the first moment that Joe Biden announced his candidacy in April of last year after the horrors of Charlottesville and beyond, and not only that chose the one and only Kamala Harris based upon her record of fighting for the people, clearly their mission was to fight for the soul of this country which moved us all so deeply. Their fire in the heart burns as bright as the sun in the sky and every star in the universe that god created. Now Kamala ,who's name is Sanskrit means “Lotus” just like the flower that grows to produce such beautiful pedals that can reach out and touch, do touch the soul of all those who listen possesses the strength to make a difference in this world and to build a future for the next generation. And that is something I strongly believe in: a future for the next generation free to get an education in peace without being bullied because of religion, gender, or sexual orientation. A future for women to be paid the same salaries for the same work as their male counterparts. 

The other candidate doesn't listen, the only person he listens to, is himself and deceived the people who voted him in, as a result, we had the loss of over 22O,OOO lives because of this monster called Covid-19 and also lives lost because of the bloodshed that was done because of hate and more. This man cannot be trusted to be in office again. We warned the American people in 2O16 who had a choice, either to chose life and peace and hope-filled days ahead or darkness, hate, violence and worse. The choice was made and the consequences have been disastrous sincerely. Should Biden, who has lived with a human obstacles, trials and tribulations, be elected, he is the only one who can correct some of the damage that has been done AND more.

To the people who are leaning towards or are going with trump, I want to tell you something important:

I want you to consider this when you cast your votes on November 5th or earlier for president of the United States: Ask yourself these questions: Do I want a president who has abused, dishonored, mistreated, mocked, and harassed many people because of gender, special needs, religion, and race? Do I want a president who my kids can look up to, when he writes off sexual assault as “locker room” talk? Do I want a president who cares only about building a wall to isolate and deny those who seek the American dream? Do I want a president who wants to lead our country down a dark path of bigotry, hate, and distrust? Do I want a president who has a temperament of a 2 year old? Do I want a president who has lied and caused lives to be lost because of a monster named Covid-19? Do I also want a president who idolizes evil men such as Hitler and other dictators and would want generals to follow his rules and not obey the Constitution of the United states?!

OR…

Do I want a president who will embrace all people and give every single person a chance to live and dream big, to inspire change, to be included, no matter what their gender, religion, or orientation? Do I want a president with an iron-clad plan for economic and social progress continuing to move us #ONWARD #UPWARD #FORWARD and beyond? Do I want a president who I can be proud of for taking risks and WINNING because the people believed strongly enough by taking a chance to elect Kamala Harris president? Do I want a president who as a prosecutor, senator, etc. did so much to make sure our children have a future to live and to dream toward? Do I want a president who will fight to make sure that people get their fair share of the American Dream and be able to stand on their own two feet, to provide for themselves and their families?

Last and most importantly: Do I want a President that will make sure that those who have fought so hard for inclusion can finally be embraced by the world so that he can lead the next generation towards a better tomorrow? IT IS UP TO YOU now more than ever before in the history of humanity and in the history of The United States for the very first time, to stand up to this man and say: HATE ABSOLUTELY does NOT belong here, in the White House, or anywhere. LOVE DOES BELONG in America and the world! NOW is the time! NOW is OUR moment! NOW is our chance to make history and do what is right for the future of this country. I pray and ask from my heart on behalf of “we, the people” that you hear the cries of “Love Trumps Hate” and “Good Can Win over Evil” and finally declare we reject demagogues like Donald Trump once and for all!!

Please remember me and all those who fought so hard for their right to be heard and seen. Remember women. And most importantly, please, for the sake of people who seek the dream of equality, justice, love, compassion, and for the great heroes who sacrificed everything for us to live in peace and freedom and be whatever we want to be: remember the people when you cast your votes on November 5th I know where my vote lies with...it goes to Kamala Harris sincerely for SHE knows US! 

This country’s future rests with you, it is now in your hands! VOTE BLUE 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 TO SAVE DEMOCRACY AND AMERICA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🩵

An Special Letter to the Editor Written By Christopher C. Gagliardi

To most importantly the undecided voters,
This is a message that I asked to be not edited nor toned down. This is something I had to write because I had felt the deep urgency to write to the press about. In less than 11 days from today, the nation's future will be decided upon by you...the people of this country. But already as we speak, many have already made their decision and the uncertainty of this has me greatly worried, and with good reason. I would like to tell you a important story as to why your vote and your voice matters to me and to others. I am a 43-year-old male loving life to the fullest, enjoying everything that makes America a place that I love very much. 

I may look normal today, but forty - three years ago, I was born with a challenge called “infantile autism.” At that time, no one really understood autism, and my frequent “tantrums,” aloof affect, and inability to speak baffled the people around me. I felt like a caged animal. I was frustrated because I lacked the ability to explain my thoughts and feelings, and simultaneously oblivious to the fact that was I unable to communicate. You see, Autism can be lonely, especially early on.

I was the only one who knew how hard it was to be autistic, because I lived it and felt that no one could understand me or my experience. My hometown didn’t have the correct special education programs for autistic or other special needs children, so I was bussed out to other public schools in neighboring school districts, which presented it’s own challenges. Among the challenges that people who are on the spectrum deal with every day, there was transitioning from a home and small-town environment to a new larger environment and school system. Another thing that is difficult sometimes for People with special needs is that they are expected to acclimate, even in school, to common-place daily events like holiday celebrations, decorating the classrooms, and other activities. Yet as a person with this kind of challenge with no steps to help me transition, to me, this was torturous and painful. In addition, there is the horrific and painful reality of bullying. I was called names, called “retarded,” and subjected to physical violence, but my language abilities were not yet available to me and I didn’t have the capacity to tell my mom what was happening. Soon I was developing my ability to speak, and as my physical ability grew so did my desire to speak out to support rights for those who needed them. 

My confidence grew and I was fortunate to have the warmth and endless support of people who believed in me then and still believe in me now. The result has been a lifetime of breakthroughs: allowing my mom to hug me for the first time at sixteen-years-old after a bad encounter with bullying; a little acting, and some music; working as a community activist seeking to deliver a message about the rights of people with special needs; running for and winning roles in high school government up to and including student council president; and even taking a chance on college although there is still a need to fully address correct transitional programs for those with special needs seeking to move into a collegiate setting. In 2005, because of my work as a community activist, I was honored by my political peers as a hero among Bergen County’s residents. I did these things by transforming “the impossible into the possible,” and by refusing to surrender or listen to negativity. I accomplished these goals with the faith, love, and support of every single individual on my side that I was blessed to have surrounding along my entire journey.

Their love and support lead to my decision that I would dedicate my life to fighting for change through politics and to bring attention to the issues that affect citizens with special needs. I have been fortunate enough to have been in the political game since I was, believe it or not, 12 years of age. I've made phone calls and campaigned for candidates. Whether at the grassroots level, by getting out the vote with phone banks, or deciding to run for New Jersey State Assembly in the 37th legislative district. You read that correctly. At the time, I was concerned that no one could truly represent the physically and mentally challenged citizens of our state. I educated myself on how to get onto the ballot, took the train with my petition and signatures to Trenton, New Jersey, and filed. My platform was simple: I was and still am for change in this country, a country I love so deeply. My attempt at a run for elected office got attention in media outlets and the story reached as far as the northwestern United States. In the summer of 2009, I won 15% in the primaries for my race. My opponents were so impressed that they appointed me the first Special Needs Outreach Advocate. 

All my life I can say that I am proud of the liberties that have been afforded to me and I take seriously the solemn responsibility of protecting them. Which is why I must now use this word: INCLUSION. Inclusion means to eradicate the exclusion of physically and mentally challenged people who cannot enjoy a normal life in school or society. And I will tell you that Exclusion or denial of someone's right to live a happy life especially here in this great country is WRONG. In my life, whenever I had doubts about my abilities or felt like I had failed, my dear friend and mentor Peter Noonan always told me: “You create your own destiny!”
This leads me to the point of my letter and why this important election effects not just me, but millions of people with special needs in our country. 

As I said earlier I was born with Infantile Autism. I have been fortunate enough to have been in the political game since I was, believe it or not, 12 years of age. I've made phone calls and campaigned for candidates. I ran for the state assembly and helped eradicate the R word from the language in our state and also to make the toughest Anti-Bullying bill of rights. Why can I say all these things, it is because I can say that I was NEVER EVER scared of doing these things. Until Now.

I can honestly admit that for as long as I can remember, I can not recall a time in the history of this country or in the history of the 21st century had I ever seen a election where the very future of our country and all that we have so fought hard for, especially our rights as a person with special needs, is at stake in this election. In the year 2016 I was in absolute SHOCK when I watched Donald J. Trump mock a reporter with special needs during one of his campaign stops in the last presidential election. When you attack and mock someone with special needs, it is not only a violation of their rights, but of every single citizen with special needs and their families, period. As a person with special needs, I have a great fear for people with special needs and for others that if I woke tomorrow and heard the results that could be one of the greatest tragedies in our modern times.

I am frightened by the prospect that people cannot get to the voting poll, because of the current crisis we are facing, where the ballots are going and a president that will show a lack of care, compassion, taking care of people, sitting in the white house for another 4 years continuing to abuse the very office the people vote to give him.

Donald Trump, DOES NOT represent America. The only thing that he represents is the almighty dollar, and when he looks out at his supporters and constituents, all he sees is money in his pocket. The hardship and struggle that people have endured for so long in silence due to bullying, because of traits that we were born with should not hold us back from what we can achieve and contribute to social progress. My brothers and sisters, and fellow Americans who are reading this letter, I am crying out from the mountaintop and declare with a roar on behalf of all people with special needs that “I am a human being. My life has value. My freedom I do not take lightly.” 

All that my mom and I fought for is something we cherish deeply and yet he does not see us as American citizens trying to show the world that people with special needs can DO and ACCOMPLISH greatness! It is the fear Donald Trump used to make us feel small, unappreciated and worse. I cannot and will not allow such a travesty of injustice to be done, not just to those who struggle with special needs day after day, but to women, LGBTQPIA citizens, and citizens of every faith, nationality, and creed. They all should be given the same historic opportunities that this nation has given to me. This election provided those citizens with a candidate who encompassed courage, compassion, grace, dignity and more throughout her entire life, and that has gone above and beyond the call of duty in fighting for every single individual’s god-given potential.

To the people who are undecided, hear me. There is only ONE candidate who can stand up and help bring our country back from the brink of the abyss, someone who has a great understanding of us, as individuals, as AMERICANS indeed, no matter what preference of gender, religion, nationality, etc. and he too, like me, has a challenge that he fought so hard for, her name? Kamala Harris.She has a record that is bar none extraordinary and the obstacles and hardships he has faced in HER life is a living testament to her service in the senate and as President Joe Biden  Vice President for 4 years clearly shows she is ready to lead our country to build America better, stronger, brighter, hope-filled and true to the words of our constitution to make our country: “A more perfect union”. 

Time and again she has proven herself to be the most qualified candidate to run for the presidency maybe ever. From the first moment that Joe Biden announced his candidacy in April of last year after the horrors of Charlottesville and beyond, and not only that chose the one and only Kamala Harris based upon her record of fighting for the people, clearly their mission was to fight for the soul of this country which moved us all so deeply. Their fire in the heart burns as bright as the sun in the sky and every star in the universe that god created. Now Kamala ,who's name is Sanskrit means “Lotus” just like the flower that grows to produce such beautiful pedals that can reach out and touch, do touch the soul of all those who listen possesses the strength to make a difference in this world and to build a future for the next generation. And that is something I strongly believe in: a future for the next generation free to get an education in peace without being bullied because of religion, gender, or sexual orientation. A future for women to be paid the same salaries for the same work as their male counterparts. 

The other candidate doesn't listen, the only person he listens to, is himself and deceived the people who voted him in, as a result, we had the loss of over 22O,OOO lives because of this monster called Covid-19 and also lives lost because of the bloodshed that was done because of hate and more. This man cannot be trusted to be in office again. We warned the American people in 2O16 who had a choice, either to chose life and peace and hope-filled days ahead or darkness, hate, violence and worse. The choice was made and the consequences have been disastrous sincerely. Should Biden, who has lived with a human obstacles, trials and tribulations, be elected, he is the only one who can correct some of the damage that has been done AND more.

To the people who are leaning towards or are going with trump, I want to tell you something important:

I want you to consider this when you cast your votes on November 5th or earlier for president of the United States: Ask yourself these questions: Do I want a president who has abused, dishonored, mistreated, mocked, and harassed many people because of gender, special needs, religion, and race? Do I want a president who my kids can look up to, when he writes off sexual assault as “locker room” talk? Do I want a president who cares only about building a wall to isolate and deny those who seek the American dream? Do I want a president who wants to lead our country down a dark path of bigotry, hate, and distrust? Do I want a president who has a temperament of a 2 year old? Do I want a president who has lied and caused lives to be lost because of a monster named Covid-19? Do I also want a president who idolizes evil men such as Hitler and other dictators and would want generals to follow his rules and not obey the Constitution of the United states?!

OR…

Do I want a president who will embrace all people and give every single person a chance to live and dream big, to inspire change, to be included, no matter what their gender, religion, or orientation? Do I want a president with an iron-clad plan for economic and social progress continuing to move us #ONWARD #UPWARD #FORWARD and beyond? Do I want a president who I can be proud of for taking risks and WINNING because the people believed strongly enough by taking a chance to elect Kamala Harris president? Do I want a president who as a prosecutor, senator, etc. did so much to make sure our children have a future to live and to dream toward? Do I want a president who will fight to make sure that people get their fair share of the American Dream and be able to stand on their own two feet, to provide for themselves and their families?

Last and most importantly: Do I want a President that will make sure that those who have fought so hard for inclusion can finally be embraced by the world so that he can lead the next generation towards a better tomorrow? IT IS UP TO YOU now more than ever before in the history of humanity and in the history of The United States for the very first time, to stand up to this man and say: HATE ABSOLUTELY does NOT belong here, in the White House, or anywhere. LOVE DOES BELONG in America and the world! NOW is the time! NOW is OUR moment! NOW is our chance to make history and do what is right for the future of this country. I pray and ask from my heart on behalf of “we, the people” that you hear the cries of “Love Trumps Hate” and “Good Can Win over Evil” and finally declare we reject demagogues like Donald Trump once and for all!!

Please remember me and all those who fought so hard for their right to be heard and seen. Remember women. And most importantly, please, for the sake of people who seek the dream of equality, justice, love, compassion, and for the great heroes who sacrificed everything for us to live in peace and freedom and be whatever we want to be: remember the people when you cast your votes on November 5th I know where my vote lies with...it goes to Kamala Harris sincerely for SHE knows US! 

This country’s future rests with you, it is now in your hands! VOTE BLUE 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙 TO SAVE DEMOCRACY AND AMERICA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🩵

Hey all,

So I voted for Kamala, but I know she won’t win. I just don’t think Kamala has any chance to win. Not only do I think trump will win, but I believe he’ll have a massive landslide Reagan-like victory.

My gut has has always told me who’d win every election since 1996, the first time I voted. I knew Trump would win in 2016. I knew Biden would win in 2020. This time, my gut is telling me Trump. 

Everything just points to a massive Trump landslide. On election night,  I’m expecting a Trump win. I think you guys should too, for the sake of your mental health.

"« House Speaker Mike Johnson is in Syracuse, N.Y., today in a final push to re-elect the Republican widely considered to be one of the nation’s most vulnerable: Representative Brandon Williams, whose district is in Central New York.

But the campaign hit a snag when Johnson was asked whether he would repeal the CHIPS Act — one of President Biden’s signature achievements — which just so happens to be bringing $100 billion worth of investment in the semiconductor industry to the Syracuse area.

“I expect we probably will,” the speaker replied matter of factly.

Williams soon jumped in to say that he opposed repealing the CHIPS Act and would lobby the speaker.

It was an awkward moment — made all the more so by Williams’s own history of deriding the deal that will bring the semiconductor manufacturer Micron to the Central New York region as “corporate welfare.” Now he was again in the familiar position of affirming his support for Democratic legislation, even as he argued that Democratic policies had destroyed the country.

Shortly after the event, Williams’s team issued a statement saying that Speaker Johnson supported reforming the CHIPS Act, rather than repealing the legislation: “I spoke privately with the speaker immediately after the event.

"I saw others sharing their story, I figured it was worth sharing mine. 

I grew up in a Southern Baptist home under a staunch Texan mom and Marine Veteran Step Dad. As you can imagine, I just didn’t know any other life for many years and the intersection of my influences resulted in a conflation of my religion with my politics. I was young, so I don’t feel guilt but I do feel a little shame. 

You see, my upbringing was filled with unspoken hate. It was never deliberately spelled out for me or my siblings, but it was there. I hated the LGBTQ+ communities for being so obstinate in the eyes of god; “learn to control your sinful urges” was the foundation of how I understood their “lifestyle” (in quotes because I now understand it isn’t a *lifestyle choice* but rather *people trying to live their lives*). I hated immigrants for their desire to take what was rightfully mine as an American (the Good Samaritan was lost on me because I applied intent on people I had never met). I hated people of color through willful ignorance (never overtly, but rather a feeling of repulsion when the onus of the past fell on white people). But most of all, I hated democrats as an amalgamation of everything that was wrong in the world. 

I have to give one piece of significant credit to my parents, however; they instilled in me what I understood conservatism to be. A conservation of finances through economic policy that benefitted everyone, social policy that allowed people to rise out of poverty, and emotional policy that required deep thought with good faith questioning (“trust but verify” they would say). If you can see where this is going, I eventually began to use these foundations to put my beliefs to the test. 

Luckily for me, I was in high school during an era in which medical marijuana was only just beginning to enter the zeitgeist. There were news stories and documentaries and personal essays abound; despite not using cannabis I was intrigued. My father worked in the medical industry, so I dug in to find that the medical benefits were extraordinary! It was only a hop, skip, and a jump to finding out why cannabis had been made illegal in the first place: “Reefer makes darkies think they’re as good as white men. The primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races.”
— Harry Anslinger, Founding Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics

This was glaringly obvious racism, the kind I was unfamiliar with. It was bold, overt, and just plain wrong. I researched the policies of politicians I supported, and they had no real reason to support the prohibition of cannabis beyond maintaining the status quo. A status quo whose origins were firmly planted in racism and nothing else. 

The first shift in my beliefs came to a head when Mike Huckabee gave a sermon at my southern Baptist mega church… while he was campaigning for President. It just felt… wrong. 

I abandoned my party… for the libertarians. I still felt strongly about the left being bad guys, and found a group who outwardly maintained similar feelings for the right. I remained a Ron Paul libertarian for years. 

Until I started a job where I met Stephen. Stephen was funny, supportive, thoughtful, a good co-worker, and eventually a great friend. He had studied political science in school, and took this job in an unrelated field to support his girlfriend through school. We got to talking and he gently asked about my political beliefs. I think he understood quickly that I wasn’t exactly the most informed guy, that I knew just enough to be angry. He validated my feelings about libertarianism, but inquired what I liked about it. I ultimately conceded that I didn’t think it was a viable vote, but that the protest vote might get enough attention to force conservatives to enact “the fair tax.” A flat 12% tax felt fair on a very surface level, but Stephen, without judgement, explained how that puts an unfair burden on the lower class. The class of workers in which I existed. 

My mind was immediately opened to how backward some of my hard held beliefs actually were. 

The third blow to my beliefs came from Robert Reich’s “inequality for all,” a documentary I recommend to everyone to this day. I had to know more, was every fabric of how I understood the world warped? In that moment, I made a decision to be okay with being wrong, even if it only meant I could correct course and be “right” again. 

I read The People’s History of the United States, I listened to lectures and speeches from Bernie Sanders, I paid attention to the stories of women, I questioned everything until my understanding became more complete. 

In 2016, I cast my first vote on the left for Hillary Clinton. 

Winning me over, a southern baptist boy for learned everything he knew through the lens of the GOP, took time, a pure attitude of curiosity, and a whole lot of patience. 

I called Stephen years after I worked with him to thank him for his gentle approach. The fact that he remained open to hearing me, despite knowing where I stood and how deep those roots were, was fundamental to my growth. 

Looking back and seeing this growth, I’m proud of it. I’m proud of myself. I can’t go back to harboring hate and sowing division. We can’t go back.

### Legal Charges Against Trump

#### ""Trumped up"" Charges and Lack of Merit

**1. Hush Money Case in New York City:**

**Federal Election Commission (FEC) Findings:**
- The FEC reviewed the nondisclosure agreement related to the alleged hush money payments and did not find any violations of federal election laws. This determination suggests that there was no illegal activity regarding campaign finance.

**Credibility of Witness:**
- Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and the key witness for the prosecution, has been disbarred and has a documented history of lying, which raises questions about the reliability of his testimony.

**2. Jan. 6 Case:**

**Trump’s Call for Peaceful Protest:**
- During his speech on January 6, Trump explicitly said, “Let’s go up to the Capitol and protest peacefully and patriotically.” This statement indicates that Trump did not incite violence but instead called for a lawful demonstration.

**3. Georgia Election Case:**

**Legal Interpretation of Trump’s Statement:**
- In a phone call with Georgia officials, Trump expressed concerns about election fraud and said, “I need to find 11,000 votes.” Legal experts argue that this statement can be interpreted as a request to identify legal votes rather than an attempt to fabricate new ones. This interpretation suggests that Trump was seeking a legitimate recount or verification process.

**4. Classified Documents Case:**

**Declassification and Security Measures:**
- Trump claimed to have declassified the documents in question before leaving office and stored them securely at Mar-a-Lago. Declassification authority lies with the President, and securing the documents in a locked room indicates an effort to protect sensitive information.

**Comparison with Biden’s Document Handling:**
- President Biden was found to have mishandled classified documents, some of which dated back to his time as Vice President. Despite this, Biden has not faced similar legal action, highlighting a potential inconsistency in how these cases are treated.

**5. New York Real Estate Case:**

**Financial Impact on Banks:**
- Trump repaid all loans associated with the real estate transactions in question, and the banks involved reportedly did not suffer any financial losses; instead, they made profits. This lack of financial harm to any party questions the necessity of legal action, as there is no clear victim.

### Political Motivation and Public Perception

**Claim of Political Motivation:**
- There is a widespread belief among Trump’s supporters that the legal actions against him are politically motivated, aiming to hinder his 2024 presidential campaign. This perception is bolstered by the timing and nature of the charges, which many see as attempts to undermine his candidacy.

**Public Reaction:**
- Polls and public opinion indicate that a significant portion of the American electorate views the legal challenges against Trump as unfair and politically driven. This belief could influence voter behavior, potentially increasing support for Trump in the 2024 election.

### Today's Polling Statistics from FiveThirtyEight (June 2024)

According to FiveThirtyEight, Trump is performing as follows in the latest polls:
- In head-to-head matchups against President Biden, Trump is consistently within a few percentage points, indicating a highly competitive race.
- Among Republican primary voters, Trump maintains a substantial lead over other potential candidates, with support hovering around 50% or higher in most polls.

"One of the media and the left's favorite memes is that Trump and his supporters are a ""threat to Our Democracy"".

They made this accusation whenever anyone disagreed with their plans or the current narrative, and every time Trump's name was mentioned.  Democrat politicians say it, the media repeats it, and ""Intelligence Officials"" reinforce it.

In 1974, not long after Joe Biden entered the Senate, he was on television in a town hall type setting, answering questions.  Speaking on campaign finance reform, [he claimed he was 'ready to prostitute himself' to moneyed interests, but they turned him down because he had no influence.](https://x.com/Heritage/status/1679901877381607436)

Remember that in 2014, Robert Gates, Obama's Secretary of Defense said of Biden ""I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades”

Biden has a long history of making racist statements and policy positions.

In 2018, Biden went on national TV and bragged about getting a prosecutor in Ukraine, who was looking into the theft of $2 billion in US aid, fired - by threatening to withhold $1 billion more in US aid.  Not mentioned was that the person who committed the theft had hired Hunter Biden for a no-show job he wasn't qualified for, at $1 million per year.

In 2020, Politico reported that Obama said ""Don't underestimate Joe's ability to f*** things up.""

Further, by the time 2020 rolled around, it was clear to any unbiased observer that Biden was beginning to have cognitive issues.

Nearly half of the state governors are Democrats, some of them quite popular.  In addition to the governors, there were many members of Congress, mayors, and people who were no longer in office but could have run.

...but the DNC, the movers and shakers in Washinton DC, and the media all solidified behind Biden as their chosen candidate, even to the extent of cheating against Bernie in the primaries (again).

Why pick someone who our Intelligence officials knew was corrupt, and everyone else should have *suspected* was corrupt, who had a history of incompetence and racism, and who now had cognitive issues that everyone who had close contact with him for any extended period could not miss?

Intelligence Officials knew he was corrupt.  They'd been covering for him for years, burying investigations and evidence.  All the decades he was stealing classified documents from the Senate, they knew.  Democrat officials knew he was incompetent, as Gates and Obama both said.  He made it clear to everyone he was stupid, by publicly outing his own corruption from 1974 to the present.  ...and everyone who had any sort of extended contact with him from 2020 on - from administration officials, to journalists, to foreign dignitaries, could see he was having cognitive issues.

Remember that the DNC and media have spent the last 4 years **lying** to us about Biden's cognitive issues, and continued to do it until it could no longer be denied.  Some few are still doing it.  Every time he did or said something that made it clear he was having difficulty operating at a basic level, the usual suspects made excuses instead of doing their duty to the country, to the American public, and **to Democrat voters**.

Biden should never have been chosen as the candidate in 2020, but people can fool themselves up to a point to avoid having to face unpleasant reality.  ...but we're now at a point where Biden's deterioration has been obvious for years.

Instead of admitting this and taking steps to address it, the DNC, government officials, Democrat Congressional leaders, and the media have all done their best to hide and excuse it - calling anyone who dared to say the Emperor had no clothes every name they could think of.

What could be a greater threat to 'Our Democracy' than having a President in office who was corrupt, stupid, and incompetent **before** his dementia became too advanced for him to function reliably?

...but not satisfied with endangering the country by keeping Biden in office for his first term, the people propping Biden up decided to run him for re-election in 2024.  ...and not only did they decide to run him for 2024, they did their best to ensure that Biden had no significant opposition in the Democratic Primaries - thus robbing **Democrat voters** of the opportunity to choose a better Democratic candidate.  This wasn't an accident.

So now, there are finally calls to replace Biden as the 2024 nominee.  ...now that Democrat voters no longer have a voice in who that might be.  Either the party elites who hid Biden's decay from you will choose a new nominee without your having a say... or they will try to foist Biden on you again, knowing he is incapable of functioning as President.

Remind me again of who the threat to 'Our Democracy' is.",1719713646,43,Republican,,A Threat to Our Democracy - Something to Jog the Memory of Our Democrat Lurkers,"A Threat to Our Democracy - Something to Jog the Memory of Our Democrat Lurkers One of the media and the left's favorite memes is that Trump and his supporters are a ""threat to Our Democracy"".

They made this accusation whenever anyone disagreed with their plans or the current narrative, and every time Trump's name was mentioned.  Democrat politicians say it, the media repeats it, and ""Intelligence Officials"" reinforce it.

In 1974, not long after Joe Biden entered the Senate, he was on television in a town hall type setting, answering questions.  Speaking on campaign finance reform, [he claimed he was 'ready to prostitute himself' to moneyed interests, but they turned him down because he had no influence.](https://x.com/Heritage/status/1679901877381607436)

Remember that in 2014, Robert Gates, Obama's Secretary of Defense said of Biden ""I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades”

Biden has a long history of making racist statements and policy positions.

In 2018, Biden went on national TV and bragged about getting a prosecutor in Ukraine, who was looking into the theft of $2 billion in US aid, fired - by threatening to withhold $1 billion more in US aid.  Not mentioned was that the person who committed the theft had hired Hunter Biden for a no-show job he wasn't qualified for, at $1 million per year.

In 2020, Politico reported that Obama said ""Don't underestimate Joe's ability to f*** things up.""

Further, by the time 2020 rolled around, it was clear to any unbiased observer that Biden was beginning to have cognitive issues.

Nearly half of the state governors are Democrats, some of them quite popular.  In addition to the governors, there were many members of Congress, mayors, and people who were no longer in office but could have run.

...but the DNC, the movers and shakers in Washinton DC, and the media all solidified behind Biden as their chosen candidate, even to the extent of cheating against Bernie in the primaries (again).

Why pick someone who our Intelligence officials knew was corrupt, and everyone else should have *suspected* was corrupt, who had a history of incompetence and racism, and who now had cognitive issues that everyone who had close contact with him for any extended period could not miss?

Intelligence Officials knew he was corrupt.  They'd been covering for him for years, burying investigations and evidence.  All the decades he was stealing classified documents from the Senate, they knew.  Democrat officials knew he was incompetent, as Gates and Obama both said.

If you recall in the 2020 Election (Where Stein was not on the ballot), Biden barely edged out Trump in the swing states of AZ, GA, and WI by margins of only around 10,000 allowing Biden to get his needed 270 electoral votes. Thats a margin of less than 0.5% in many cases. Looking back at the 2016 Presidential Election, the one that Trump won, Jill Stein WAS on the ballot and would regularly score tallies of 50,000+ far exceeding the margin in which Trump beat Hillary by in numerous battleground states. Jill Stein has policies to the left of Joe Biden, so we know who she takes votes from. It aint Trump.

Stein didn’t run in 2020, but she is running now in 2024 and consistently polls at around 2% for the national average. Her presence is even stronger in swing states Michigan and Wisconsin where they have a humungous Arab Muslim population, traditionally democrat but very unhappy with Biden’s handling of Israel/Palestine. She can easily scoop up 80,000+ democrat votes in those ultra tight swing state races against Trump, looking at her past performance and current vitality and energized base d/t Palestine war. (A war not going on in 2016).

A swing state that is to be decided by less than 10,000 votes in Biden’s favor can now easily swing in full force towards Trumps column of electoral votes and tank Biden’s chances of another term. Trump only needs to pick up ONE state of the Democrat “Great Blue Wall” (MN, WI, MI, PA, VA, NH, Maine) in order to clobber Joe and get to 270, if he flipped AZ and GA red (current polling suggests he will). You can easily see Jill Stein as a powerful spoiler to Joes vote tallies in critical swing states and her actions alone can throw those states RED and re-elect donald Trump. 

Add to the fact that Biden had an approval rating of 56%, disapproval of 34% back in November 2020. Now these numbers have swapped places (take the reciprocal of approval to disapproval in 2020 and you have Joe’s current rating now in 2024). Trump’s have remained merely the same.

Jill Stein 2024 seems to have blown a massive hole into the hull of the Biden 2024 ship and water is now rushing in at an unstoppable rate like the titanic. Joe hit a Jill Stein Ice Berg so to speak. But what do you guys think? Do you agree?

"I am unironically thanking Joe Biden for his service to our country, because this election is already over and it’s time for me to become Republican again.

But this isn’t about our once and future president, it’s about the terribly flawed one we have right now, the one I helped put into office, Joe Biden. 

Most of my experience in supporting the Democratic Party these past few years has been, galling and utterly disappointing. The moment they could no longer identify a woman I knew there was no future there, and I set about trying to find my way back to my roots, but the party I knew is gone

 I am happy now with many of the developments in this party I was skeptical of before. This Republican Party will actually shrink the the Federal Government instead of slowing it’s growth. State’s Rights to self determination will flourish once again and a new balance will be reset. America as a whole needs to take a step back from the world and regroup. 

The failure of Neocons such as myself was not that we wanted something bad, global stability is a wonderful thing, but that we wanted it too badly. We forgot the costs at home and lost sight of our purpose. 

We’ve gone through so many debacles with Biden I can’t help but be embarrassed for my vote for him on those counts, but in one thing I am very glad he stepped up. In supporting Zelenskyy he prevented Ukraine from being overrun, and avoided a security crisis in NATO. 

I know any praise for the soon to be vanquished President will give many here a case of indigestion, but in this he was the man for the hour. 

I know many in the party wish a complete withdrawal of aid, and  that should happen in time, but aid should continue so that Trump can negotiate this Peace from a position strength, not weakness. Biden, although laudable for standing up for Ukraine could not stand down because of his own feebleness.

 Only Trump can bring Peace.

"I'm seeing so much ignorance about this, which is not really the fault of the youth, it is a failure of our schools and of our older citizens to make sure we impart this understanding. It's also the left's fault because they have been pushing for ignorance on these issues. Why? That ignorance gives the left a foothold where it shouldn't because it can leverage what you don't know by offering ""solutions"" to things that aren't problems, ultimately giving the left more control. The communists did this to overthrow governments and it worked. Sowing ignorance is a powerful tool and it takes diligence to combat it. They are using our collective ignorance to fool us into bad ideas that will give them whoever is in power far too much power.

**Why are SCOTUS justices not elected?**

Because they are supposed to be free from having to make campaign promises they cannot and should not make. There are supposed to interpret the Constitution, they are supposed to use their wisdom, they are supposed to not be pressured to make a decision based on the fact that another election is coming up. 

They are also appointed as a check to their own power. By involving the Legislative branch (the law makers) and the Executive branch (those who enforce the laws and defend our nation) in the appointment of the justices neither the president or congress has all the power in the decision. It is also supposed to give us all some trust that there was relative agreement from both parties that the appointed justice would rule fairly and as unbiasedly as possible.

**Why are there no terms or upper age limits for a SCOTUS justice?**

The point was that if these are the only people serving our federal government with lifetime appointments then the shifts between parties that can happen every election cycle can't also rock the court. The court mores (stabilizes) the government so that if one party sweeps an election and thinks they can control everything the way they want, the court is there to check them.

This is good for everyone. The left hates this, but they don't recognize that anyone can become a tyrant. We can all be a tyrant and we need mechanisms to stop ourselves from becoming tyrants as well as the party we disagree with. Lifetime appointments to the court help prevent us from becoming tyrants.

So both the president and the congress have to approve an nomination to the court, and then no one can touch them for their life time. It was a check and balance and it was deliberate (though admittedly the role of the SCOTUS wasn't really decided until Marbury vs. Madison, which established judicial review).

**Well how do we deal with senility in the courts without an age limit?

First, they are not like the president or congress. We need a president to be virile and able to act in the middle of the night when an enemy attacks or when there is some other crisis. The courts do not need to act fast, they need to be wise. Young people can be wise, but wisdom tends to come with age. 

Also, a sudden departure of a justice does not jam up the country and make us vulnerable to our enemies.

If a justice becomes too old to act in their appointed capacity for whatever reason, there is a process to remove them. It is seldom used largely because it hasn't needed to be. Usually if a justice approaches such a time as Biden has, they have stepped down. But **there is a process to remove them should that need arise**. We need to be open to using it, but again, the need hasn't really arisen.

There could be room for some cognitive testing or something, but at the same time, do you trust the other party not to try and fudge the results or lie about the results to try and get what they want?

**What about term limits, wouldn't that help?**

No. First of all, how long should they be? To short and you ruin the stabilizing power of the court. Too long and you might as well make them for life. Also, will they be up for re-election or will the need to be re-appointed? Either way, you have that problem of that affecting their decisions for political expedience rather than based on the law as it is written.

I know it sounds like a reasonable thing on the surface, which is why this discussion gains so much steam from time to time, but it is not a good idea and the people doing it are trying to appeal to that superficial sort of sense it makes to fool you into a bad decision. If they try to convince of this, then they are either ignorant themselves, or more likely, they think you are ignorant and will give them more power by saying things that sound good to you.

Also, think about how that would look. If a term is ending, they would have to campaign if they can serve again, OR each party would select their nominees far in advance and campaign with them. It would effectively make a SCOTUS seat and elected seat, which leads us to the same problems I mentioned before as well as that justice being beholden to the party the campaigned with them. That is dangerous.

**What about packing the court? Should we do that when we don't get what we want out of the courts?**

First of all, ""packing the court"" means when you don't get what you want from the court, you change the law and add more justices to the court (there is no limit in the Constitution and originally there were only 5 justices). This is dangerous, this is what they do in banana republics, and as far as I am aware, only progressive liberal types have ever tried. Roosevelt tried to back the courts for all his New Deal stuff which was largely unconstitutional, but enough retired that he was able to appoint liberal judges to get what he wanted anyway. There was a threat from Obama and Biden both, but they backed off, frankly because Trump wasn't afraid to accuse them of trying to do that. It was undoubtedly on their agenda.

It should be immediately clear why packing the courts is bad. Even if it works for your side one time, years down the line when the conditions are just right to both pass an increase in justice seats AND pick the justices you want, then you could topple the government.

Packing the court is **not** the same as making a lot of appointments to the court. The left will tell you that Trump packed the courts by appointing many justices to both the Supreme Court and to lower courts. This is not true. Remember that all appointments to lower courts also require approval from legislative bodies (for the most part anyway... there are obviously local courts that are election based in many places).

Educate yourself on why we have these structures in place because they are there to protect you and to protect this nation. While there are sometimes ideas thrown around that sound really reasonable on the surface, the people that are selling them to you probably are selling you down river to a future you don't want.",1721229161,1,Republican,,why the supreme court is structured as it is - Please Read this if you think term limits for the SCOTUS are a good idea.,"why the supreme court is structured as it is - Please Read this if you think term limits for the SCOTUS are a good idea.

First, they are not like the president or congress. We need a president to be virile and able to act in the middle of the night when an enemy attacks or when there is some other crisis. The courts do not need to act fast, they need to be wise. Young people can be wise, but wisdom tends to come with age. 

Also, a sudden departure of a justice does not jam up the country and make us vulnerable to our enemies.

If a justice becomes too old to act in their appointed capacity for whatever reason, there is a process to remove them. It is seldom used largely because it hasn't needed to be. Usually if a justice approaches such a time as Biden has, they have stepped down. But **there is a process to remove them should that need arise**. We need to be open to using it, but again, the need hasn't really arisen.

There could be room for some cognitive testing or something, but at the same time, do you trust the other party not to try and fudge the results or lie about the results to try and get what they want?

**What about term limits, wouldn't that help?**

No. First of all, how long should they be? To short and you ruin the stabilizing power of the court. Too long and you might as well make them for life. Also, will they be up for re-election or will the need to be re-appointed? Either way, you have that problem of that affecting their decisions for political expedience rather than based on the law as it is written.

I know it sounds like a reasonable thing on the surface, which is why this discussion gains so much steam from time to time, but it is not a good idea and the people doing it are trying to appeal to that superficial sort of sense it makes to fool you into a bad decision. If they try to convince of this, then they are either ignorant themselves, or more likely, they think you are ignorant and will give them more power by saying things that sound good to you.

Also, think about how that would look. If a term is ending, they would have to campaign if they can serve again, OR each party would select their nominees far in advance and campaign with them. It would effectively make a SCOTUS seat and elected seat, which leads us to the same problems I mentioned before as well as that justice being beholden to the party the campaigned with them. That is dangerous.

**What about packing the court? Should we do that when we don't get what we want out of the courts?**

First of all, ""packing the court"" means when you don't get what you want from the court, you change the law and add more justices to the court (there is no limit in the Constitution and originally there were only 5 justices). This is dangerous, this is what they do in banana republics, and as far as I am aware, only progressive liberal types have ever tried. Roosevelt tried to back the courts for all his New Deal stuff which was largely unconstitutional, but enough retired that he was able to appoint liberal judges to get what he wanted anyway. There was a threat from Obama and Biden both, but they backed off, frankly because Trump wasn't afraid to accuse them of trying to do that. It was undoubtedly on their agenda.

It should be immediately clear why packing the courts is bad. Even if it works for your side one time, years down the line when the conditions are just right to both pass an increase in justice seats AND pick the justices you want, then you could topple the government.

Packing the court is **not** the same as making a lot of appointments to the court. The left will tell you that Trump packed the courts by appointing many justices to both the Supreme Court and to lower courts. This is not true. Remember that all appointments to lower courts also require approval from legislative bodies (for the most part anyway... there are obviously local courts that are election based in many places).

Educate yourself on why we have these structures in place because they are there to protect you and to protect this nation. While there are sometimes ideas thrown around that sound really reasonable on the surface, the people that are selling them to you probably are selling you down river to a future you don't want.",0.083,0.809,0.108,0.9797,positive
"I'm seeing so much ignorance about this, which is not really the fault of the youth, it is a failure of our schools and of our older citizens to make sure we impart this understanding. I am sorry we don't talk about this more, I'm as at fault as anyone else. It's also the left's fault because they have been pushing for ignorance on these issues. Why? That ignorance gives the left a foothold where it shouldn't because it can leverage what you don't know by offering ""solutions"" to things that aren't problems, ultimately giving the left more control. The communists did this to overthrow governments and it worked. Sowing ignorance is a powerful tool and it takes diligence to combat it. They are using our collective ignorance to fool us into bad ideas that will give them whoever is in power far too much power.

**Why are SCOTUS justices not elected?**

Because they are supposed to be free from having to make campaign promises they cannot and should not make. There are supposed to interpret the Constitution, they are supposed to use their wisdom, they are supposed to not be pressured to make a decision based on the fact that another election is coming up. 

They are also appointed as a check to their own power. By involving the Legislative branch (the law makers) and the Executive branch (those who enforce the laws and defend our nation) in the appointment of the justices neither the president or congress has all the power in the decision. It is also supposed to give us all some trust that there was relative agreement from both parties that the appointed justice would rule fairly and as unbiasedly as possible.

**Why are there no terms or upper age limits for a SCOTUS justice?**

The point was that if these are the only people serving our federal government with lifetime appointments then the shifts between parties that can happen every election cycle can't also rock the court. The court mores (stabilizes) the government so that if one party sweeps an election and thinks they can control everything the way they want, the court is there to check them.

This is good for everyone. The left hates this, but they don't recognize that anyone can become a tyrant. We can all be a tyrant and we need mechanisms to stop ourselves from becoming tyrants as well as the party we disagree with. Lifetime appointments to the court help prevent us from becoming tyrants.

So both the president and the congress have to approve an nomination to the court, and then no one can touch them for their life time. It was a check and balance and it was deliberate (though admittedly the role of the SCOTUS wasn't really decided until Marbury vs. Madison, which established judicial review).

"I live in Washington and can't really be candid with friends or talk about this at work, so here we go. I have two things I different things I want to get off my chest- I hope Trump wins, and I hope Kamla loses.

**TRUMP YES:** Trump is freaking amazing for me and I really wish he runs the 2024 elections. He's done more for legal immigration for Indians trying to work in the US than any other president in the last decade - from stopping H1B abuse to being fairly vocal about how he intends to fix the 30+ year backlog on getting residency (see [all in podcast](https://youtu.be/blqIZGXWUpU?t=2626)). I'm by no means asking for what Canada or Australiais- a shit show where they let any and everyone in to abuse social safety nets. But- I do appreciate efforts to let folks like me who've been here since a decade be given the chance to start their own companies instead of working a 9 to 5 for half their life before they're able to pause and try starting something up of their own. Goddamn I hope he wins.

**KAMLA NO:** I really hope Kamala doesn't win. I've read her policies and stances on immigration- she wants to help folks who are here illegally, but I haven't found her saying or doing anything to help those trying to immigrate here legally who are burdened by decades old immigration systems that feel discriminatory based on nationality. You want to help folks who illegally crossed in and give them and their kids free resources despite not contributing to the economy? How about you do that after helping those who are trying to legally immigrate in and bring in, per immigrant, potentially $60k+ per person in taxes? How about trying to help those in who will actually benefit the US vs. be a goddamn drain on your resources?

========================

Longer, less emotional ramble:

I'm in the US on an H1-B right now. I completed my undergrad among the top of my class from UW Seattle, and have been working and growing in the field for 5 years (now a senior engineer). I want to take a break from work and start my own company- a process that takes several months. But- I cannot do that under an H1-B visa. I'm from India and I have to wait 30+ years for permanent residency to be able to start my own company (other countries get it in 3-6 months). My plans been to head back to India and start my own company there with all my savings. If Trump is able to achieve what he said- that being getting folks who graduated from a US college permanent residency early on in his second term- I'm sold. I'd love to continue working in the US itself- I love the work ethic of folks here, and while India is great- nothing matches the talent pool, conferences, and level of access you have from within the US itself.

Trump has historically been amazing for legal immigration- he cracked down on companies like TCS flooding the job market with hundreds of applicants for the same person. This person would be employed at a low cost, and be outsourced within the US to other companies, while TCS would skim the difference. Under his presidency- he enforced one application per person, and that if you're hiring somebody on this visa- they must be working directly for you. He cracked down on a lot of abuse of this system- and made it easier for folks like me to get a hold of this visa and work here in the US. I do have concerns about the dems blocking his proposed idea, or it being included with irrelevant amendments and getting blocked- but am faithful in Trump being re-elected and enacting policies to benefit legal immigration into the US. He is goddamn fantastic for folks like me- and he cannot win quickly enough.",1721596018,67,Republican,,As an Indian trying to immigrate into the US- Trump cannot win soon enough,"As an Indian trying to immigrate into the US- Trump cannot win soon enough I live in Washington and can't really be candid with friends or talk about this at work, so here we go. I have two things I different things I want to get off my chest- I hope Trump wins, and I hope Kamla loses.

**TRUMP YES:** Trump is freaking amazing for me and I really wish he runs the 2024 elections. He's done more for legal immigration for Indians trying to work in the US than any other president in the last decade - from stopping H1B abuse to being fairly vocal about how he intends to fix the 30+ year backlog on getting residency (see [all in podcast](https://youtu.be/blqIZGXWUpU?t=2626)). I'm by no means asking for what Canada or Australiais- a shit show where they let any and everyone in to abuse social safety nets. But- I do appreciate efforts to let folks like me who've been here since a decade be given the chance to start their own companies instead of working a 9 to 5 for half their life before they're able to pause and try starting something up of their own. Goddamn I hope he wins.

**KAMLA NO:** I really hope Kamala doesn't win. I've read her policies and stances on immigration- she wants to help folks who are here illegally, but I haven't found her saying or doing anything to help those trying to immigrate here legally who are burdened by decades old immigration systems that feel discriminatory based on nationality. You want to help folks who illegally crossed in and give them and their kids free resources despite not contributing to the economy? How about you do that after helping those who are trying to legally immigrate in and bring in, per immigrant, potentially $60k+ per person in taxes? How about trying to help those in who will actually benefit the US vs. be a goddamn drain on your resources?

"Dear Mr. Trump, I hope you or a member of your staff reads this as I have a story to tell, not my story but of a great American. I am a 2 time voter excited for round 3 here. But this isn’t about you as president or politics or business. Thank you for all you’ve done for America in all those areas. This message is for my Grandpa, a great and free man, who grew up poor working in the steel yard. In early adulthood he played professional baseball as a pitcher, he then was drafted into WWII and served in the European theatre leading up to VE Day and stayed after to help with reparations. As he was helping to rebuild europe after the worst war our world has ever and hopefully will ever see, he focused on sports as he was an athlete. He helped create the German professional basketball league and played in it as a player/coach for many years. When his tour in europe was finished and it was finally time to return home to the country he loved he did not return to play baseball but to enjoy the country he just fought to safeguard its liberties. He met an incredible, who might I say was then and still is today a beautiful and kind woman, truly a diamond in the rough. My grandfather was the most incredible man I ever met and she felt the same way. After living in several states they eventually moved to a small town with their 3 amazing girls. Where they decided to stake their ground and grow roots. My grandfather started a small business that was passed on to his daughter, who with her husband operated it for years until they eventually sold to a larger company for a profit while securing their employees jobs. My grandfather loved golf more than most things, family, god, and Busch were his top 3. He played as much as he could and as long as he could. He was the man who taught me to play golf and he always called me partner. He was a bigger guy standing over 6’4 every bit of 220 lbs, a man I wouldn’t have wanted to mess with when he was 70 let alone when he was 20. I am 99% positive Hitler saw a picture of him coming across the great Atlantic Ocean and said no more, that American is too tough. My grandfather passed away a few years back, he lived the American dream. To cut to the chase watching you play golf with Bryson in the under 50 challenge reminded me of him on the course. Your swing, your stance, your confidence, your demeanor, your attitude. If I squinted my eyes it felt as if I was watching him again. Thank you for that, Mr. Trump. Now I understand my childhood hero was not perfect, he struggled with alcohol, with temptation, and was a sinner just like you and I. But that is why I believe in you. We are not a sum of all of our bad decisions and choices we make, but of who we choose to be everyday. We are what we stand up for and the people we stand for. We are all in America Americans and we choose everyday to live our lives in hate or in love. I love you Mr. Trump just as I love Joe Biden and I loved my grandfather, because we are all Americans and we cannot allow hate to enter our hearts, lest we forget the men and women who came before. One of my favorite quotes, “I  killed my brother with malice in my heart… hatred destroyed my family” I do come here with one tall order, one serious ask, one favor from one American to another. Win, and when you do restore our great country to the land of opportunity my grandfather lived in. A land where a poor steel yard worker can without a college degree, play professional sports, serve his country, own a home, afford to raise a beautiful family and run a successful business, but most importantly live a life without fear and fully free to chase the American Dream. Restore my generations hope that we can build a life that will leave our children better than when we were handed it. Restore our country so my future children can dream, so they can be fearless, so they can love their fellow man regardless of political, sexual, religious, or racial orientations. Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, poor, rich, Republican, Democrat, gay, straight, we are all American, and I think it is high time we start to all respect each other as Americans. One nation under God, indivisible. Don’t do it just for me and our fellow Americans, do it for those that came before us, for all the men and women who fought and those that died for us all. I believe in this country, my grandfather believed in this country. Thank you and god bless you Mr. Trump.

"Hi everyone,

I’ve been here a little bit in the past but just wanted to say I am proud to say I am voting Trump this November. 

I decided this about a month or so ago. I’ve usually voted 3rd party/libertarian candidates in the past, I voted Jo Jorgensen in 2020 and realized that this is not doing me or our country any good. As much as RFK Jr could be a good candidate he’s not going to win more than likely. 

I grew up in the south, have lived in liberal cities, lived in red states and blue states, currently live in a liberal city. I’ve noticed that Biden/Harris don’t care about helping build up lower income communities and instead it’s all about hand outs, it’s not about building them up as people, giving them places to work, job skills, and helping get people on their feet. It’s about keeping them down so they rely on them and will vote for them every election cycle, but the kicker is every 3/3.5 years is when democrats rediscover these communities and pander to them. I’m sick and tired of seeing it as someone who lives near these communities. I want to see these people grow and flourish and make something of themselves, but instead I see the people who are actually getting legit help from the government are not even legal citizens here as we saw in Chicago/New York/Texas/California.

I’m tired of the democrats only caring about people specifically every election cycle and getting hardly anything done in between. 

In terms of Trump, while he’s not my favorite person, I think he’s better than Kamala Harris. I feel that his policies will help the population far more than Kamala Harris.

With Trumps legal history that we all know about, I think the justice system is highly against him for political reasons, I think he’s a manufactured felon and not an actual felon, I think Alvin Bragg and the DOJ took a weird misdemeanor and bumped it up to 34 felony counts. This is the same DA in NYC who’s taken violent felons and lowered them to misdemeanors. I believe he is being weaponized and it’s all to keep him out of office and I can see right through that and I hope you all can as well.

Joe Biden has taken classified information and been given a slap on the wrist, Hillary Clinton destroyed evidence and was given a slap on the wrist. I think Trump can be given a slap on the wrist and given a pass like the other 2.

I also don’t believe the whole project 2025 narrative they’re trying to create, this is a foundation that’s been trying to push a hard right agenda for decades and they’ve never been successful and they’re not going to be successful with Trump now. Pay attention to his offical agenda, Agenda47.

When there was the assassination attempt, I saw Trump put his fist in the air and tell people to fight for what they believe in, and I think we should fight for a better America for all Americans.

At the end of the day, I do not want a SF progressive as a president. I think Trump will be better at keeping us safe, helping our economy grow, bringing higher wages back to our workers in this country, and helping get the US back to where it belongs. He’ll be better for all groups of people and help everyone grow consistently. I think Trumps strong stances are what we need for the country and that’s a strong border, strong economy, ending wars overseas and negotiating peace deals. I believe he will win but keep spreading the word. 


Btw, my family all live in a very competitive swing state and I am making sure they vote Trump as well. 

Thank you all for reading.

I believe he is being weaponized and it’s all to keep him out of office and I can see right through that and I hope you all can as well.

Joe Biden has taken classified information and been given a slap on the wrist, Hillary Clinton destroyed evidence and was given a slap on the wrist. I think Trump can be given a slap on the wrist and given a pass like the other 2.

I also don’t believe the whole project 2025 narrative they’re trying to create, this is a foundation that’s been trying to push a hard right agenda for decades and they’ve never been successful and they’re not going to be successful with Trump now. Pay attention to his offical agenda, Agenda47.

When there was the assassination attempt, I saw Trump put his fist in the air and tell people to fight for what they believe in, and I think we should fight for a better America for all Americans.

At the end of the day, I do not want a SF progressive as a president. I think Trump will be better at keeping us safe, helping our economy grow, bringing higher wages back to our workers in this country, and helping get the US back to where it belongs. He’ll be better for all groups of people and help everyone grow consistently. I think Trumps strong stances are what we need for the country and that’s a strong border, strong economy, ending wars overseas and negotiating peace deals. I believe he will win but keep spreading the word. 


Btw, my family all live in a very competitive swing state and I am making sure they vote Trump as well. 

Thank you all for reading.

"Hey folks, I see a lot of people, younger folks especially, who do not know the overall history of media and the left/right divide. So I wanted to post a brief history to show you (in broad strokes) why we are where we are so you know how to argue against the leftists who think FOX News is somehow the most powerful media entity that is unduly swaying everything without being contest.

**The Ancient History of Media... well, before Mass Media**

Before the radio and before television, people relied on news papers. There were generally competing newspapers in every city. Some printed every day, some printed twice daily (you might get a morning paper and an afternoon). Most major cities had newspapers that were politically biased, and there was definitely sensationalized headlines to sell said papers but it was largely seen as a noble profession which kept some of that at bay. There was sometimes corruption, but largely there was healthy competition. In a town where I grew up, up until about 1995, there was a paper for Democrats and there was a paper Conservatives. This was a blue state and only the Democrat one survived as the internet was taking hold.

The point is that there was always competition politically in the media, there were always sensational headlines (though some publications were better than others just like today), and there were always people trying to use the media to sway political opinion for better or for worse. [Boss Tweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Tweed), a famously corrupt New York politician, was taken down by political cartoons published in papers that were effective because illiterate voters understood what the cartoons meant even if they couldn't read.

**Mass Media Begins**

Newspapers really were the first mass media, but we more think of radio and TV as the beginning. Those industries have a really fascinating history, but what people need to know is that their model works much like the fast food franchise system works. This developed over time, but this model is repeated in many industries today, including media.

McDonalds has a headquarters that produces food. They have a marketing team, they have a chef that tests new product ideas, etc. Their business is not really to sell food to consumers, but to sell food to their own franchises. You or I could own a McDonald's franchise, there are rules about it, there is licensing agreement, etc., but once I have a McDonald's restaurant, I make money by selling hamburgers to customers, McDonald's Corporate makes money because I'm buying their hamburger patties, buns, cups, happy meal boxes, etc. I can make special deals with my customers, special coupons, etc. or maybe there is a national campaign for the McRib that just doesn't sell well near me so I don't bother with it (that's why you here, ""in participating locations"" on the ads sometimes).

We have a symbiotic relationship, they make money from me, I save money in advertising and have some support from corporate.

Now, McDonald's Corporation can own an individual restaurant (and they do, usually in their biggest markets), I as an individual can own as many franchises as I want, or a company can purchase a bunch of franchises. Whoever owns it is abiding by certain legal agreements about how to sell, what to sell, and where to buy from (namely McDonalds' corporate).

This is how radio and television work. The major networks of radio were centered in NYC. ABC, NBC, and CBS started there, and then they kind of franchised out, except their ""franchises"" were called ""affiliates"" and you could only have one affiliate per market. An NBC affiliate might be owned by NBC Corporate, it might be owned by an individual, or it might be owned by a company. In each case, the affiliate plays NBC Corporate content during certain times of day (namely primetime) and then they can buy content or produce their own locally to play at other times of day. 

The Federal Communications Commission was involved in licensing radio signals in all local markets because the market did need some regulation. Part of the law stipulated that these radio frequencies that started with radio and expanded into TV, had to be for the public good, so they HAD to produce news for the people and later they had to be part of the Emergency Broadcast System.

News was a requirement and all local affiliates had to produce news to abide by this law, and the networks had to provide national news. This was the least competitive part of the broadcasts. NBC, ABC, and CBS had very similar broadcasts for decades, and because it was seen as the public good, competing during those times (though they did) was not as critical as competing with their hit comedy shows and dramas but they way the competed was less about sensational headlines and more about getting the ""scoop"". Anyway, this news requirement is why you see local news frequently during the 6pm, national news at 6:30 and then primetime differs depending on your timezone.

This affiliate network system spread with radio first, and the shortly after television. In 1948 1% of US households had TV. By 1955, 75% did.

The same networks that dominated radio dominated TV. This is why the big three networks were and still are ABC, CBS, and NBC. 

This is how mass media began. 3 companies produced all the live news for pretty much all Americans for decades. Newspapers followed a similar model, but there was more diversity in content until news papers really began to die in the 1990s, though they were on their way out since cable.

**The Slow Descent into the Left**

I won't go into politics and the control of the media, nor international pressures and communist tactics during the cold war. For now, let's assume that these major media companies that wielded a tremendous amount of influence over the vast majority of Americans was entirely honest and not corrupt at all.

These companies, their entertainment shows, and their news shows both, started sliding left. There was kind of a robust system that didn't let it go too far one way, at least to start. And yet coverage was more favorable to Democrats than Republicans.

Why? There are many reasons, but I think a huge one is simply who is drawn to entertainment and journalism. It is largely people on the left. That is not their fault. It is not some conspiracy, they are just drawn to such positions the way the right is drawn to engineering and law enforcement. So opinions just seeped in that way, and it was subtle. I'm trying to find the Larry Elder clip but I'll settle for this [John Stossel clip about media bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7voF2YTBeb8&t). Just be aware that what I'm talking about is even more subtle from before this. Headlines were worded just slightly different. If Democrat president started up abortion funding, they were doing something noble, if a Republican president ended abortion funding, they ""appeasing their base"".

This bias was ubiquitous. You saw it in newspapers that were purportedly unbiased, you heard it in radio broadcasts, and you saw it on tv coverage. The clip from Stossel is very recent, but this phenomena has been in play since the Cold War and has only gotten worse. Studies have shown this to be true, but it is also just very obvious from looking at it.

**A Course Correction in TV- DUN DUN DUN**

In 1969, The Corporation for Public Broadcasting started, which if you don't know, is a government subsidized television and radio network (even after some cuts) that also operates with money donated by people, corporations, philanthropic groups. You may recognize NPR and PBS. These were always biased, but really moved significantly left in the 90's. Why? Again, the types of people who go into broadcasting in general tend to be left, and throw on top of that working for the ""public good"" and you get the folks they have today.

in 1980 CNN began on cable TV, which competed with the big networks by offering 24 hours news. These were the same kinds of people, so it had the same kind of bias, just faster, and they relied a bit more on sensationalized stories because they had more time to play with.

In 1986 however, the great Satan (according to the left) came to be. News Corp and FOX television began.

FOX was started by Rupert Murdoch who was and is conservative, but he started it because he recognized an under-served portion of the American population: Blacks, Hispanics, and poor whites.

FOX was (and is) affiliate network but its business was a little different that allowed it to get away with not producing local news, namely that it only ran syndicated TV programs when it began. FOX could kind of skirt the laws and provided more air time to their local affiliates (you'll notice FOX ends prime time at 10 while the others end at 11). I won't go into all the ways Murdoch did this and why, it's a bit complicated, but eventually FOX started making good money and could produce its own content that served and under served part of the community. 

Eventually FOX produced shows like Tracy Ulman, which gave rise to The Simpsons. They produced In Living Color, the first sketch comedy show that was primarily black performed and written. They produced The Simpsons. The ventured into late night talk comedy with Arsenio Hall. They became a full blown network. The eventually needed local news to compete, so they would partner with local affiliates of other networks. In my market, our local ABC affiliate station's news team covers the local FOX News as well.

But at it's start, FOX was just entertainment.

10 years later, News Corp started FOX News on cable to compete directly with CNN, which was left leaning, as well as add another level of competition to the big networks ABC, CBS, and NBC.

The left had dominated the industry for pretty much its whole existence, and then FOX bit into their entertainment, and then their news. 

If anyone ever tells you that the right has control of the media, you know that they don't know about media history.

**Some Final Points**

The left-biased media has bascially always been the incumbent over the airwaves and now over the internet. They had the established systems in place, they had the money, they could move their radio personalities to the TV, then they could move their TV personalities to the internet with money to back them up. The pioneers of the new forms of media are never the incumbent, in other words the first podcasts are small and independent, but once that system is started, the legacy media follows right behind along with FOX (which I don't consider legacy media). So you get your Joe Rogans starting a trend, figuring it out, and then iHeardRadio, Spotify, Amazon, YouTube and and all these podcasting networks shoot up to kind of wrangle that system.

The left has done a tremendous job helping these huge companies build up and control the media. This also is not due to conspiracy, it just happens that new media folks tended to be more left leaning. Fortunately that is not always the case.

This history is not even close to complete but it shows you the trajectory and that FOX and more recently companies like PragerU, The Daily Wire, Steven Crowder's network, and some others are the course correction, they are not the ones dominating, they are not the establishment, they are the ones competing with the establishment.

**Sinclair**

This topic is so damn annoying. You will see the left despise Sinclair Broadcasting almost as much (or sometimes more) than FOX.

You will see a video like this one with the obnoxious [Brian Stelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGIYU2Xznb4&t). Remember how I said that NBC can own its affiliate in Buffalo, or a single individual can own it and get a license from NBC, OR a company can own the local NBC affiliate. Where there are companies, and some are pretty big that own many local affiliates. Sinclair is one such company and it has a lot of affiliates.

Keep in mind that an affiliate is like a franchise. If I have a McDonalds franchise but I love Burger King, too, I signed an agreement that says I can only sell McDonalds. So I can't strike an extra deal with Burger King.

In a similar way, if I am the NBC affiliate owner and I'm a conservative, I still have an obligation to play the NBC shows. I can ""preempt"" a show, meaning I preemptively run a different program over what NBC Corporate had planned. NBC wouldn't like that, but couldn't do much about it. Things have changed somewhat in the business so it is complicated. 

Regardless, and NBC affiliate owned by Sinclair is still trying to make money, it is still in the company's best interest to run most of what NBC Corporate gives them, and it's not like these affiliates are buying up The Daily Wire content and playing that for the local audience. They are trying to compete for ad revenue.

That Sinclair piece was made to sound scary and Sinclair can tell their affiliate news productions to run things like that. I'm not a fan of it, really, but the one Stelter was all up in arms about was actually kind of reasonable. Fake news is a major issue and many local affiliates cover things in the same dishonest ways that the national news does.

Still though, Sinclair controls some local news. Their reporters are still largely autonomous, they still have to play content from their network which is left leaning. The left still has the schools, universities, the major networks, late night talk shows, virtually all newspapers these days, virtually all magazines, most of the social media companies, social media influencers, the movie industry, the music industry, the video game industry, the sports industry, the comic book industry...

If they complain about Sinclair and that video, show them how when the democrats come up with a new talking point like ""JD Vance is weird"", show them how every single politician of theirs, all their newspapers, all their social media stars, all their musicians, movie stars, podcasters, magazines, all the talking heads on CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, how they all say the *exact same thing*. Someone in the DNC decides the talking point and virtually all of media repeats it. That is messed up.

I hope this helps.",1723069819,5,Republican,,Know your History: The Media.,"Know your History: The Media. Hey folks, I see a lot of people, younger folks especially, who do not know the overall history of media and the left/right divide. So I wanted to post a brief history to show you (in broad strokes) why we are where we are so you know how to argue against the leftists who think FOX News is somehow the most powerful media entity that is unduly swaying everything without being contest.

**The Ancient History of Media... well, before Mass Media**

Before the radio and before television, people relied on news papers. There were generally competing newspapers in every city. Some printed every day, some printed twice daily (you might get a morning paper and an afternoon). Most major cities had newspapers that were politically biased, and there was definitely sensationalized headlines to sell said papers but it was largely seen as a noble profession which kept some of that at bay. There was sometimes corruption, but largely there was healthy competition. In a town where I grew up, up until about 1995, there was a paper for Democrats and there was a paper Conservatives. This was a blue state and only the Democrat one survived as the internet was taking hold.

The point is that there was always competition politically in the media, there were always sensational headlines (though some publications were better than others just like today), and there were always people trying to use the media to sway political opinion for better or for worse. [Boss Tweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Tweed), a famously corrupt New York politician, was taken down by political cartoons published in papers that were effective because illiterate voters understood what the cartoons meant even if they couldn't read.

**Mass Media Begins**

Newspapers really were the first mass media, but we more think of radio and TV as the beginning. Those industries have a really fascinating history, but what people need to know is that their model works much like the fast food franchise system works. This developed over time, but this model is repeated in many industries today, including media.

McDonalds has a headquarters that produces food. They have a marketing team, they have a chef that tests new product ideas, etc. Their business is not really to sell food to consumers, but to sell food to their own franchises. You or I could own a McDonald's franchise, there are rules about it, there is licensing agreement, etc., but once I have a McDonald's restaurant, I make money by selling hamburgers to customers, McDonald's Corporate makes money because I'm buying their hamburger patties, buns, cups, happy meal boxes, etc. I can make special deals with my customers, special coupons, etc. or maybe there is a national campaign for the McRib that just doesn't sell well near me so I don't bother with it (that's why you here, ""in participating locations"" on the ads sometimes).

We have a symbiotic relationship, they make money from me, I save money in advertising and have some support from corporate.

Now, McDonald's Corporation can own an individual restaurant (and they do, usually in their biggest markets), I as an individual can own as many franchises as I want, or a company can purchase a bunch of franchises. Whoever owns it is abiding by certain legal agreements about how to sell, what to sell, and where to buy from (namely McDonalds' corporate).

This is how radio and television work. The major networks of radio were centered in NYC. ABC, NBC, and CBS started there, and then they kind of franchised out, except their ""franchises"" were called ""affiliates"" and you could only have one affiliate per market. An NBC affiliate might be owned by NBC Corporate, it might be owned by an individual, or it might be owned by a company. In each case, the affiliate plays NBC Corporate content during certain times of day (namely primetime) and then they can buy content or produce their own locally to play at other times of day. 

The Federal Communications Commission was involved in licensing radio signals in all local markets because the market did need some regulation. Part of the law stipulated that these radio frequencies that started with radio and expanded into TV, had to be for the public good, so they HAD to produce news for the people and later they had to be part of the Emergency Broadcast System.

News was a requirement and all local affiliates had to produce news to abide by this law, and the networks had to provide national news. This was the least competitive part of the broadcasts. NBC, ABC, and CBS had very similar broadcasts for decades, and because it was seen as the public good, competing during those times (though they did) was not as critical as competing with their hit comedy shows and dramas but they way the competed was less about sensational headlines and more about getting the ""scoop"". Anyway, this news requirement is why you see local news frequently during the 6pm, national news at 6:30 and then primetime differs depending on your timezone.

This affiliate network system spread with radio first, and the shortly after television. In 1948 1% of US households had TV. By 1955, 75% did.

The same networks that dominated radio dominated TV. This is why the big three networks were and still are ABC, CBS, and NBC. 

This is how mass media began. 3 companies produced all the live news for pretty much all Americans for decades. Newspapers followed a similar model, but there was more diversity in content until news papers really began to die in the 1990s, though they were on their way out since cable.

**The Slow Descent into the Left**

I won't go into politics and the control of the media, nor international pressures and communist tactics during the cold war. For now, let's assume that these major media companies that wielded a tremendous amount of influence over the vast majority of Americans was entirely honest and not corrupt at all.

These companies, their entertainment shows, and their news shows both, started sliding left. There was kind of a robust system that didn't let it go too far one way, at least to start. And yet coverage was more favorable to Democrats than Republicans.

Why? There are many reasons, but I think a huge one is simply who is drawn to entertainment and journalism. It is largely people on the left. That is not their fault. It is not some conspiracy, they are just drawn to such positions the way the right is drawn to engineering and law enforcement. So opinions just seeped in that way, and it was subtle. I'm trying to find the Larry Elder clip but I'll settle for this [John Stossel clip about media bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7voF2YTBeb8&t). Just be aware that what I'm talking about is even more subtle from before this. Headlines were worded just slightly different. If Democrat president started up abortion funding, they were doing something noble, if a Republican president ended abortion funding, they ""appeasing their base"".

This bias was ubiquitous. You saw it in newspapers that were purportedly unbiased, you heard it in radio broadcasts, and you saw it on tv coverage. The clip from Stossel is very recent, but this phenomena has been in play since the Cold War and has only gotten worse. Studies have shown this to be true, but it is also just very obvious from looking at it.

1 - Biden is clearly incapacitated. Harris is highly culpable in his retention of the office and this is a national security risk.

##The Trump Campaign's Path Forward: A Focus on Democracy

The Trump campaign's primary focus should be on the issue of democracy. As a lifelong Democrat who has consistently aligned with progressive values, including supporting Bernie Sanders in the 2016 election and backing Hillary Clinton since her 2008 campaign, I have never once voted for a Republican. However, in this election, regardless of what happens from this point forward, I will be voting for Donald Trump.

This decision is not based on Trump's personality or policies, nor is it influenced by Kamala Harris's character or her political stances. For me, the choice is clear and straightforward: the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has undermined our democracy.

The DNC's actions, including their handling of primary elections and treatment of certain candidates, have eroded my trust in the party's commitment to fair democratic processes. This betrayal of democratic principles is the driving force behind my decision to support Trump, as I believe the integrity of our democracy must be preserved above all else.

For Trump to have a better shot at the presidency, the RNC should emphasize the importance of democracy and how the current administration and party leadership have failed in this regard. By focusing on these fundamental democratic values, the Trump campaign can attract voters like myself who feel disillusioned and betrayed by the Democratic Party.

let's ask another question

##Why Did the DNC Choose Kamala Harris Despite the Risks?

The DNC's decision to select Kamala Harris as the presidential candidate, despite the risks, is strategic. They understand that any internal debate could be catastrophic for the party and its chances in the presidency.

We face significant problems in many liberal cities like Portland, Seattle, and San Francisco. I urge you to look into San Francisco's $950 theft threshold, which has led to widespread crime and driven businesses away from the city.

However, you might struggle to find this information because Google, Facebook, and other social media platforms heavily censor content. Unless you're consistently tuning into right-wing media, these stories are virtually unknown to the average Democrat.

The left-leaning media engages in heavy censorship. While they may not lie outright, they selectively hide information to manipulate public opinion and maintain support. If Kamala Harris were to engage in debates and take a firm stance, whether liberal or conservative, it could cause a split within the Democratic Party.

The DNC is fully aware of this risk. That's why, despite warnings from former President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Bernie Sanders, and others, they pushed their agenda forward.

The RNC needs to seize this opportunity if they want a shot at winning.


##Are We Willing to Sacrifice Democracy Just Because We Dislike a Candidate?

This is a critical question we must ask ourselves. Are we really prepared to give up on the principles of democracy simply because we hate the candidate from the other party?

Demonizing someone to gain votes is fundamentally wrong. When we allow such tactics to influence our decisions, we're effectively taking the power of choice away from the public. Democracy thrives on informed and free choice, not on manipulation and fear-mongering. When a candidate is vilified to sway votes, it distorts the democratic process and undermines the very foundation of our system.

It's not just about one election—it's about protecting the integrity of our democracy for generations to come. Let's ensure that our votes are based on informed decisions rather than on tactics designed to manipulate our emotions.


As a former liberal and long-time Democrat, I know countless ways to effectively counter the DNC, not just by addressing their policies but by understanding how they communicate and operate.

There are many Americans, across both parties, who value the principles of democracy above all else. These are the people we need to reach.

I am willing to speak with any RNC or campaign member, whether from Trump’s or Vance’s team, to share my insights and strategies. If you believe in protecting our democracy, I’m ready to join the effort to ensure a successful campaign in 2024.

Kamala Harris’s Radical, Liberal version of Project 2025, more formally known as the [~Blueprint for the 21st Century~](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/blueprint-21st-century/). This initiative was crafted by the [~Center for American Progress~](https://www.americanprogress.org/our-supporters-2022/) (CAP), an organization heavily funded by George Soros. For those who prefer visual explanations, there’s a [~video~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&v=D8qLiifuZyI&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanprogressaction.org%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanprogressaction.org&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE) that breaks down the details. CAP’s influence on Democratic leadership is undeniable—its founder, John Podesta, served as White House Chief of Staff under President Bill Clinton from 1998 to 2001 and later led Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential campaign. The same individuals who played key roles in the Clinton administration, which orchestrated policies that devastated Black communities, are still wielding significant power today. Podesta currently holds the position of Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. Meanwhile, CAP’s CEO, [~Patrick Gaspard~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Gaspard), previously headed George Soros’s Open Society Foundations before taking the helm at CAP. The connections run deep, as evidenced by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz [~posing for photos with Alexander Soros~](https://imgur.com/a/skxcgSe) at the DNC last night. CAP also has a [~strong~](https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-staff-center-for-american-progress-podesta-tanden-think-tank-2021-3) presence in the White House. 

As you start to piece together the narrative being spun by the Democrats, particularly around Project 2025, it’s hard not to notice the irony—or rather, the hypocrisy—of it all. The Democratic National Committee's leadership is engaging in a clear and calculated deception, and everyone should be concerned, and then angry. 

Also, you should notice how they always point the finger [~first~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier), generate [~false stories~](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/how-fake-persona-laid-groundwork-hunter-biden-conspiracy-deluge-n1245387) to help discredit dissenting views, only to be [~caught later~](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024.08.19-Report-of-the-Impeachment-Inquiry-of-Joseph-R.-Biden-Jr.-President-of-the-United-States.pdf) and when it is too late. 

---

The Center for American Progress (CAP) recommendations in the Solutions Initiative 2024 are a textbook example of absurdity disguised as ""inclusive growth."" Here’s why these proposals are not just radical but dangerously out of touch with reality:

1. **Tax Hikes Galore**: CAP suggests raising the top individual income tax rate to a staggering 44.6% for those earning over $1 million and implementing a 25% minimum income tax on households worth over $100 million, including unrealized capital gains. This is nothing short of punitive taxation aimed squarely at successful Americans who drive economic growth. It's a blatant attack on the American Dream, punishing people for their success and potentially driving capital out of the country, crippling investment and innovation.
2. **Medicare Madness**: CAP’s ""Medicare 2.0"" proposal is a bureaucratic nightmare waiting to happen. By rolling Medicare Parts A, B, and D into one massive, one-size-fits-all plan, CAP is advocating for an unwieldy system that will likely lead to reduced quality of care and increased wait times. The cherry on top? It’s funded by further gutting Medicare Advantage, a program that millions of seniors prefer because it offers flexibility and additional benefits. CAP's plan doesn’t modernize Medicare; it burdens it with more inefficiencies and overregulation.
3. **Free Everything, Paid by You**: CAP’s plan reads like a socialist utopia—free community college, massive expansions in childcare, early education, and even housing subsidies. But there's nothing free about it. These programs would be paid for by hard-working Americans through aggressive tax hikes and by further indebting the nation. This is not ""inclusive growth""; it's a recipe for economic stagnation and the destruction of personal responsibility.
4. **Deficit Hypocrisy**: Despite claiming to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio, CAP’s plan balloons federal spending to 25.7% of GDP by 2054, with the national debt still skyrocketing to over 118% of GDP. This is hardly fiscal responsibility—it's a smokescreen for unbridled government expansion. CAP’s approach will leave future generations with the bill for today’s reckless spending, compromising their financial freedom and economic opportunities.

In short, CAP’s recommendations are not just absurd—they're an all-out assault on the principles that have made America prosperous. These proposals would stifle innovation, punish success, and burden future generations with insurmountable debt, all in the name of a misguided vision of ""inclusive growth."" It's radical, it's reckless, and it must be called out for what it is: a dangerous path toward economic ruin",1724456622,8,Republican,,VooDoo CooCoo Kamila Reveals What A Harris/Walz Presidency Looks Like,"VooDoo CooCoo Kamila Reveals What A Harris/Walz Presidency Looks Like

For those who prefer visual explanations, there’s a [~video~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&v=D8qLiifuZyI&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanprogressaction.org%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanprogressaction.org&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE) that breaks down the details. CAP’s influence on Democratic leadership is undeniable—its founder, John Podesta, served as White House Chief of Staff under President Bill Clinton from 1998 to 2001 and later led Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential campaign. The same individuals who played key roles in the Clinton administration, which orchestrated policies that devastated Black communities, are still wielding significant power today. Podesta currently holds the position of Senior Advisor to the President for International Climate Policy. Meanwhile, CAP’s CEO, [~Patrick Gaspard~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Gaspard), previously headed George Soros’s Open Society Foundations before taking the helm at CAP. The connections run deep, as evidenced by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz [~posing for photos with Alexander Soros~](https://imgur.com/a/skxcgSe) at the DNC last night. CAP also has a [~strong~](https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-staff-center-for-american-progress-podesta-tanden-think-tank-2021-3) presence in the White House. 

As you start to piece together the narrative being spun by the Democrats, particularly around Project 2025, it’s hard not to notice the irony—or rather, the hypocrisy—of it all. The Democratic National Committee's leadership is engaging in a clear and calculated deception, and everyone should be concerned, and then angry. 

Also, you should notice how they always point the finger [~first~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_dossier), generate [~false stories~](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/how-fake-persona-laid-groundwork-hunter-biden-conspiracy-deluge-n1245387) to help discredit dissenting views, only to be [~caught later~](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024.08.19-Report-of-the-Impeachment-Inquiry-of-Joseph-R.-Biden-Jr.-President-of-the-United-States.pdf) and when it is too late.

The Center for American Progress (CAP) recommendations in the Solutions Initiative 2024 are a textbook example of absurdity disguised as ""inclusive growth."" Here’s why these proposals are not just radical but dangerously out of touch with reality:

1. **Tax Hikes Galore**: CAP suggests raising the top individual income tax rate to a staggering 44.6% for those earning over $1 million and implementing a 25% minimum income tax on households worth over $100 million, including unrealized capital gains. This is nothing short of punitive taxation aimed squarely at successful Americans who drive economic growth. It's a blatant attack on the American Dream, punishing people for their success and potentially driving capital out of the country, crippling investment and innovation.
2. **Medicare Madness**: CAP’s ""Medicare 2.0"" proposal is a bureaucratic nightmare waiting to happen. By rolling Medicare Parts A, B, and D into one massive, one-size-fits-all plan, CAP is advocating for an unwieldy system that will likely lead to reduced quality of care and increased wait times. The cherry on top? It’s funded by further gutting Medicare Advantage, a program that millions of seniors prefer because it offers flexibility and additional benefits. CAP's plan doesn’t modernize Medicare; it burdens it with more inefficiencies and overregulation.
3. **Free Everything, Paid by You**: CAP’s plan reads like a socialist utopia—free community college, massive expansions in childcare, early education, and even housing subsidies. But there's nothing free about it. These programs would be paid for by hard-working Americans through aggressive tax hikes and by further indebting the nation. This is not ""inclusive growth""; it's a recipe for economic stagnation and the destruction of personal responsibility.
4. **Deficit Hypocrisy**: Despite claiming to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio, CAP’s plan balloons federal spending to 25.7% of GDP by 2054, with the national debt still skyrocketing to over 118% of GDP. This is hardly fiscal responsibility—it's a smokescreen for unbridled government expansion. CAP’s approach will leave future generations with the bill for today’s reckless spending, compromising their financial freedom and economic opportunities.

In short, CAP’s recommendations are not just absurd—they're an all-out assault on the principles that have made America prosperous. These proposals would stifle innovation, punish success, and burden future generations with insurmountable debt, all in the name of a misguided vision of ""inclusive growth."" It's radical, it's reckless, and it must be called out for what it is: a dangerous path toward economic ruin",0.106,0.77,0.125,0.8715,positive

"So many very minor changes add up to enough to have changed the actual outcome.  Changing a story, demoting a story, covering someone differently…. 

.03% nationally…..!!!!!  

AI’s summary of change in votes needed to have changed the outcome in 2020, makes it even more obvious an outcome in an election can change with only minimal interference.  

To determine the percentage of change in overall votes needed to have changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, we need to focus on the key states where the margin of victory was narrowest. 

The 2020 election was decided in several battleground states, with Joe Biden winning the electoral college by 306 to 232 votes over Donald Trump. However, the result could have been different if a relatively small number of votes in key states had switched sides.

For example, Biden's victories in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin were by a combined margin of about 42,000 votes. Had Trump won those states, the electoral vote count would have been tied at 269-269, sending the election to the House of Representatives. If you include Pennsylvania as well, where Biden won by about 81,000 votes, Trump would have won the electoral college outright.

To change the outcome, Trump would have needed to flip around 42,000 votes across these three states (or approximately 0.03% of the total votes cast nationally). To provide a rough estimate:

- Biden won the popular vote by approximately 7 million votes.
- To change the outcome, about 42,000 votes would need to switch, representing about **0.6% of the total votes in these key states** (which had approximately 7 million voters total).

If they were threatening to invoke the 25th amendment on Biden, wouldn't that imply that the sitting VP needs to be the acting president and wouldn't the Democrats view that as beneficial to their campaign? It just doesn't make sense to me why they're not using logic and it's actually kind of making me feel like I may be losing my mind! 

Or, am I reading too much into it and there are other legal reasons why she's not the acting president?  I'd really LOVE to see her get in there and show them what she can do 😉😂 Anyone else? ",0.079,0.766,0.156,0.9733,positive

"
Bret Baier: Madam Vice President, thank you for the time.

Kamala Harris:
Thank you. It’s good to be with you, Bret.

Bret Baier:
Voters tell pollsters all over the country and here in Pennsylvania that immigration is one of the key issues that they’re looking at this election and specifically the influx of illegal immigrants from more than 150 countries. How many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released into the country over the last three-and-half years?

Kamala Harris:
Well, I’m glad you raised the issue of immigration because I agree with you. It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have and you know what I’m going to talk about right now, which is-

Bret Baier :
Yeah, but just a number. Do you think’s 1 million? 3 million?

Kamala Harris :
Bret, let’s just get to the point. Okay. The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired.

Bret Baier :
Your Homeland Security secretary said that 85% of apprehensions-

Kamala Harris :
But I’m not finished, I’m not finished. We have an immigration system-

Bret Baier :
It’s a rough estimate of 6 million-

Kamala Harris : 
… that needs to be…

Bret Baier :
… people have been released into the country. And let me just finish. I’ll get to the question, I promise you.

Kamala Harris :
I was beginning to answer.

Bret Baier :
And when you came into office, your administration immediately reversed a number of Trump border policies, most significantly, the policy that required illegal immigrants to be detained through deportation either in the US or in Mexico. And you switched that policy, they were released from custody awaiting trial. So instead, included in those were a large number of single men, adult men who went on to commit heinous crimes. So looking back, do you regret the decision to terminate remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration?

Kamala Harris :
At the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath, the first bill that we offered Congress, before we worked on infrastructure, before the Inflation Reduction Act, before the Chips and Science Act, before the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first bill, practically within hours of taking the oath, was a bill to fix our immigration system.

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma’am. It was called the US Citizenship Act of 2021.

Kamala Harris :
Exactly.

Bret Baier :
It was essentially a pathway to citizenship for the-

Kamala Harris :
May I please finish?

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma’am.

Kamala Harris :
May I finish responding please?

Bret Baier :
But here, but this-

Kamala Harris :
But you have to let me finish, please.

Bret Baier :
You had the White House and the House and the Senate and they didn’t bring up that bill.

Kamala Harris :
I’m in the middle responding to the point you’re raising.

Bret Baier :
Okay.

Kamala Harris :
And I’d like to finish.

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma’am.

Kamala Harris :
We recognized from day one that to the point of this being your first question, it is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people. And our focus has been on fixing a problem. And from day one then, we have done a number of things, including to address our asylum system and put more resources, getting more judges, what we needed to do to tighten up penalties and increase penalties for illegal crossings, what we needed to do to deal with points of entry between border entry points. That’s the work we did.And we worked on supporting what was a bipartisan effort, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, to actually strengthen the border. That border bill would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border, which is why I believe the border patrol agents supported the bill. It would’ve allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is a scourge affecting people of every background, every geographic location in our country, killing people. It would’ve allowed us to put more resources into prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, which I have done-

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma’am

Kamala Harris :
… as the attorney general, former attorney general of a border state.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, a couple things.

Kamala Harris :
Prosecuted trafficking of drugs, guns, and human beings. And Donald Trump-

Bret Baier :
Six Democrats-

Kamala Harris :
But let me just finish. And Donald Trump-

Bret Baier :
Six Democrats voted against that bill.

Kamala Harris :
… learned about that bill and told them to kill it because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And in this election, this is rightly a discussion that the American people want to have and what they want are solutions and they want a president of the United States who’s not playing political games with the issue-

Bret Baier :
I hear you.

Kamala Harris :
… but actually is focused on fixing it.

Bret Baier :
Six Democrats voted against that bill. It would’ve allowed 1.8 million illegal immigrants into the country a year. A lot of conservatives had a problem with it. These are the six Democrats. But more importantly, back to the original premise, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were released at the beginning of the administration, well before a negotiated bipartisan bill. Former President Clinton actually referred to Laken Riley Sunday, campaigning for you in Georgia, saying if those men had been properly vetted, Laken Riley probably would not have been killed.So it wouldn’t have happened. This is well before any negotiation. This is well before Donald Trump got involved in the politics. This is a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country. So what I’m saying to you, do you-

Kamala Harris :
No, no, Bret. I think it’s really-

Bret Baier :
… owe those families an apology?

Kamala Harris :
Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. There’s no question about that. There is no question about that and I can’t imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. So that is true. It is also true that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago, it would be nine months that we would’ve had more border agents at the border, more support for the folks who are working around the clock trying to hold it all together-

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
… to ensure that no future harm would occur. And this election in 20 days will determine whether we have a president of the United States who actually cares more about fixing a problem even if it is not to their political advantage in an election, because there was a solution, Bret.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, it was a policy decision in the early part of your administration. I will let one of the mothers talk about it. Take a listen.

Speaker 3 (mother of victim) :
“Because of the Biden-Harris administration open border policy’s catch and release, they were enrolled in the alternatives to detention program. This meant that they were released into the United States. It was not even a full three weeks later that they would take my daughter, Jocelyn Nungaray’s life. I believe the Biden-Harris administration open border policies are responsible for the death of my daughter”

Bret Baier :
That’s the early days. So do you owe them an apology? Is what I’m saying.

Kamala Harris :
I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. I’m so sorry for her loss, sincerely. But let’s talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions. Let’s talk about that as well, Bret.

Bret Baier :
But do you want to answer her?

Kamala Harris :
In all fairness. I told you I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.

Bret Baier :
During that time, you said repeatedly that the border was secure. When in your mind did it start becoming a crisis?

Kamala Harris :
I think we’ve had a broken immigration system transcending, by the way, Donald Trump’s administration, even before. Let’s all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system. I’ve been clear, I think we all are, that it needs to be fixed. We need more…I was just down at the border, talking with border agents and they will tell you, and I’m sure you probably, I know you investigate and you are a serious journalist, they will tell you we need more judges. We need to process those cases faster. We need the support for those cases that should be prosecuted. They need more resources and Congress ultimately is the only place that that’s going to get fixed, Bret. That’s how the system works.

Bret Baier :
That’s the premise of this question.

Kamala Harris :
But that’s how the system works.

Bret Baier :
There were 90 plus executive orders that were rescinded in the first days. Many of those were Trump border policies. I’m not going to stay here because there’s other things to talk about, but you frequently talked to the Border Patrol Union for support of that bipartisan bill and they did. They supported it, but they also just endorsed Donald Trump and said you’ve been “a failure with border security.” Why do you think they said that?

Kamala Harris :
I think they’re frustrated and I get it. They want support. They want support, and that’s what that border security bill would’ve done. These guys down at the border, these men and women, they’re working hard. They’re working around the clock. I get it.

Bret Baier :
There’s a lot of people that look back at what you said in 2019 when you first ran for president. And there have been changes and you’ve talked about some of them. When it comes to immigration, you supported allowing immigrants in the country illegally to apply for driver’s license, to qualify for free tuition at universities, to be enrolled in free healthcare. Do you still support those things?

Kamala Harris :
Listen, that was five years ago and I’m very clear that I will follow the law. I have made that statement over and over again and as vice president of the United States, that’s exactly what I’ve done, not to mention before.

Bret Baier :
If that’s the case, you chose a running mate, Tim Walz, governor of Minnesota, who signed those very things into state law. So do you support that?

Kamala Harris :
We are very clear and I am very clear, as is Tim Walz, that we must support and enforce federal law and that is exactly what we will do.

Bret Baier :
Decriminalizing border crossings, like you said in 2019-

Kamala Harris :
I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings and I’ve not done that as vice president. I will not do that as president.

Bret Baier :
So these are evolutions that you’ve had.

Kamala Harris :
Well, let’s be very clear. I’m the only person who’s running for president who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations, from the Sinaloa Cartel, to the Guadalajara Cartel, to people who have trafficked in guns, drugs and human beings. I have spent a significant part of my career going after people who present a threat to the safety of the American people and cross our border with the intent of doing us harm and cross our border illegally. And I will do that work as vice president, I take that work quite seriously.

Bret Baier :
This is a time when voters, especially here in Pennsylvania, are inundated with commercials and ads. They just want it to stop because it’s every commercial. But many of them add noise, but a few of them seem to break through. This particular one from the Trump campaign has gotten a lot of attention.

Speaker 4 (Trump Ad) :
Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.
Kamala Harris (Trump Ad) :
“For prisoners. Every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access”

Bret Baier :
So are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender?

Kamala Harris :
I will follow the law and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You’re probably familiar with now it’s a public report that under Donald Trump’s administration, these surgeries were available to, on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system. And I think frankly, that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing stones when you’re living in a glass house.

Bret Baier :
The Trump aides say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition surgeries happened during his presidency.

Kamala Harris :
Well, you got to take responsible for what happened in your administration.

Bret Baier :
Yeah, no surgeries happened in his presidency.

Kamala Harris :
It’s in black and white.

Bret Baier :
Would you still advocate for using taxpayer dollars for gender reassignment surgeries?

Kamala Harris :
I would follow the law, just as-

Bret Baier :
Well, you have a say in as-

Kamala Harris :
… I think Donald Trump would say he did.

Bret Baier :
You would have a say as president.

Kamala Harris :
Like I said, I think it’s… He spent $20 million on those ads trying to create a sense of fear in the voters because he actually has no plan in this election that is about focusing on the needs of the American people. Whereas $20 million on that ad, on an issue that, as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American people, it’s really quite remote. And again, his policy was no different. Look at where we are though.

Bret Baier :
They say it was different, but let’s, we’ll move on.

Kamala Harris :
On plans for the American people, I’m offering a plan to deal with affordable housing. I’m offering a plan to deal with what we need to do to strengthen small businesses which are the backbone of America’s economy. I am offering a plan that is about taking care of young parents and giving them the support they need. My plans for the economy will strengthen the economy, as have been reviewed by 16 Nobel Laureates, Goldman Sachs, Moody’s, and recently the Wall Street Journal, which have all studied our plans and have indicated my plans for our economy would strengthen our economy. His would make them weaker, would ignite-

Bret Baier :
Why do you think more people say-

Kamala Harris :
… inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. Those are the facts.

Bret Baier :
Why do you think more people say they trust him on the economy than they trust you?

Kamala Harris :
I think that when you look at an analysis of our plans for what we would do as president of the United States, it has been clear to those who study and understand how economic policy works that moving forward, because I do believe the American people are ready to turn the page on the divisiveness and the type of rhetoric that has come out of Donald Trump, people are ready to chart a new way forward and they want a president who has a plan for the future and a plan that is sound and will strengthen our country. My plan for the economy does exactly that. His plan would be again to give tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations in our country and blow up our deficit.

Bret Baier :
It’s interesting you said turn the page, Madam Vice President. You were asked on two different shows last week, what, if anything, you would do differently than President Biden? Here’s what you said.

Speaker 6 (prior interview) :
Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
Kamala Harris (prior interview) :
“There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of… And I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact”
Stephen Colbert (prior interview) :
Under a Harris administration, what would the major changes be? And what would stay the same?
Kamala Harris (prior interview) :
“Sure. Well, I’m obviously not Joe Biden”
Stephen Colbert (prior interview) :
I noticed. 
Kamala Harris (prior interview) :
“So that would be one change in terms of… But also, I think it’s important to say with 28 days to go, I’m not Donald Trump”

Bret Baier :
So you’re not Joe Biden, you’re not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently?

Kamala Harris :
Let me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency. And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership.I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington D.C. I invite ideas, whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting me, who were just on stage with me minutes ago, and the business sector and others who can contribute to the decisions that I make about, for example, my plan for increasing the supply of housing in America and bringing down the cost of housing, addressing the issue of small businesses, which is about working with the private sector to bring more capital and access to capital to our small business leaders, including my plan for a $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers and for small businesses, extending the tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000.

Bret Baier :
We’ve heard a lot about those plans in recent days. Your campaign slogan is a new way forward and it’s time to turn the page. You’ve been vice president for three and a half years, so what are you turning the page from?

Kamala Harris :
Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. Rhetoric and an approach to leadership that suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we all know, the strength of leadership is based on who you lift up.

Bret Baier :
But you, Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
The strength of an American president, which is one who understands that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. That is turning the page-

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, more than 70% of people tell pollsters-

Kamala Harris :
That is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of, Bret. People are exhausted.

Bret Baier :
More than 70% of people tell the country is on the wrong track. They say the country is on the wrong track. If it’s on the wrong track, that track follows three and a half years of you being vice president and President Biden being president. That is what they’re saying, 79% of them. Why are they saying that? If you’re turning the page, you’ve been in office for three and a half years.

Kamala Harris :
And Donald Trump has been running for office since-

Bret Baier :
But you’ve been the person holding the office.

Kamala Harris :
Come on, come on.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
You and I both know what I’m talking about. You and I both know what I’m talking about.

Bret Baier :
I actually don’t. What are you talking about?

Kamala Harris :
What I’m talking about is that over the last decade, people have become-

Bret Baier :
But you’re the lever of power.

Kamala Harris :
But listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me and certainly the Republicans who are on stage with me, the former chief of staff to the President Donald Trump, former defense secretaries, national security adviser and his vice president, one, that he is unfit to serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous, and that people are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader who spends full-time demeaning and engaging in personal grievances and it being about him instead of-

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
… instead the American people.

Bret Baier :
… if that’s the case-

Kamala Harris :
People are tired of that.

Bret Baier :
If that’s the case, why is half the country supporting him? Why is he beating you in a lot of swing states? Why, if he’s as bad as you say, that half of this country is now supporting this person who could be the 47th president of the United States? Why is that happening?

Kamala Harris :
This is an election for president of the United States. It’s not supposed to be easy.

Bret Baier :
I know, but it is-

Kamala Harris :
It is not supposed to be a cakewalk for anyone.

Bret Baier :
So are they misguided, the 50%?

Kamala Harris :
Listen, let-

Bret Baier :
Are they stupid? What is it?

Kamala Harris :
Oh, God. I would never say that about the American people. And in fact, if you listen to Donald Trump, if you watch any of his rallies, he’s the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people. He’s the one who talks about an enemy within, an enemy within, talking about the American people, suggesting he would turn the American military on the American people.

Bret Baier :
We asked that question to the former president today. Harris Faulkner had a town hall and this is how he responded.

Donald Trump (town hall) :
“I heard about that. They were saying I was threatening. I’m not threatening anybody. They’re the ones doing the threatening. They do phony investigations. I’ve been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. He was the greatest gangster-“
Harris Faulkner (town hall) :
Oh my goodness.
Donald Trump (town hall) :
“No, it’s true”
Harris Faulkner (town hall) :
All right. 
Donald Trump (town hall) :
“But think of it. It’s called weaponization of government. It’s a terrible thing”

Kamala Harris :
Bret, I’m sorry, and with all due respect, that clip was not what he has been saying about the enemy within, that he has repeated when he’s speaking about the American people. That’s not what you just showed.

Bret Baier :
Well, he was asked about that specific-

Kamala Harris :
No, no, no. That’s not what you just showed, in all fairness-

Bret Baier :
No, no, no.

Kamala Harris :
… and respect to you.

Bret Baier :
I’m telling you that was the question that we asked him.

Kamala Harris :
You didn’t show that and here’s the bottom line. He has repeated it many times and you and I both know that. And you and I both know that he has talked about turning the American military on the American people. He has talked about going after people who are engaged in peaceful protest. He has talked about locking people up because they disagree with him.This is a democracy and in a democracy, the president of the United States, in the United States of America should be willing to be able to handle criticism without saying he’d lock people up for doing it. And this is what is at stake, which is why you have someone like the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying what Mark Milley has said about Donald Trump being a threat to the United States of America.

Bret Baier :
He’s quoted in the Bob Woodward book that way, yes. Let me ask you this, Madam Vice President.

Kamala Harris :
But let’s not-

Bret Baier :
You call Donald Trump-

Kamala Harris :
… diminish the significance of that.

Bret Baier :
You call Donald Trump, he’s misguided. You say now he’s-

Kamala Harris :
He’s unstable.

Bret Baier :
… unstable.

Kamala Harris :
He is unstable, Bret.

Bret Baier :
He’s not well, you say he is mentally not stable.

Kamala Harris :
He’s not stable.

Bret Baier :
Let me ask you this.

Kamala Harris :
And we should all be concerned.

Bret Baier :
You told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game, that ran around circles on his staff. When did you first notice that President Biden’s mental faculties appeared diminished?

Kamala Harris :
Joe Biden, I have watched in from the Oval Office to the situation room, and he has the judgment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people. Joe Biden-

Bret Baier :
There were no concerns raised?

Kamala Harris :
Bret, Joe Biden is not on ballot.

Bret Baier :
I understand, but-

Kamala Harris :
And Donald Trump is-

Bret Baier :
But you talked about it.

Kamala Harris :
And Donald Trump is.

Bret Baier :
After George Clooney said within a few minutes of-

Kamala Harris :
And if you watch Donald Trump-

Bret Baier :
… talking to President Biden at a fundraiser, that he thought this was not the same Joe Biden that we saw on the debate stage.

Kamala Harris :
Donald Trump is on the ballot.

Bret Baier :
I understand. You met with him at least once a week for three and a half years. You didn’t have any concerns?

Kamala Harris :
I think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump, which is why the people who know him best, including leaders of our national security community, have all spoken out. Even people who worked for him in the Oval Office, worked with him in the situation room, and have said he is unfit and dangerous and should never be president of the United States again, including his former vice president, which is why the job was open for him to choose another running mate. So that is a fact. That is a fact.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, two more things. You were asked on 60 Minutes about the biggest threat that the world faces, that the US faces. This is what you said.

Bill Whitaker (prior interview) :
Which foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?
Kamala Harris (prior interview):
I think there’s an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands. Okay? This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities.

Bret Baier :
A number of experts thought you would say China, the FBI director had said that, but you said Iran. If that’s the case, what do you say to critics who look at the actions of your administration and say you’re not acting like Iran is the number one threat?

Kamala Harris :
Well, I will tell you most recently, whether it was in April or in October, and then several hours on each occasion, that Iran posed a threat to Israel. I was there, most recently in the situation room in the most recent attack, working with the heads of our military in doing what America must always do to defend and to support Israel in its requirement to defend itself and to give American support, to be able to allow Israel to have the resources to defend itself against attack, including from Iran and Iran’s terrorist proxies in the region.

Bret Baier :
Right.

Kamala Harris :
And that is-

Bret Baier :
But those proxies were getting funded by Iran.

Kamala Harris :
And my commitment to that is unyielding and unwavering.

Bret Baier :
Critics just say that you either relaxed or failed to enforce sanctions on Iran, allowing all of this money to flow into Iran, like billions in oil profits.

Kamala Harris :
But let’s go back to Donald Trump, who-

Bret Baier :
Hold on, that-

Kamala Harris :
… pulled out of a deal that would’ve actually put Iran in check.

Bret Baier :
The estimate’s in billions.

Kamala Harris :
And then it was during Donald Trump’s administration that Iran-

Bret Baier :
… that go towards the Iran regime.

Kamala Harris :
That we had an American military base that was attacked, where American soldiers suffered traumatic brain injuries and Donald Trump dismissed them as headaches. Not to mention how Donald Trump has-

Bret Baier :
Madame Vice President, all of this money-

Kamala Harris :
… treated and talked about-

Bret Baier :
… that has gone in the past few years-

Kamala Harris :
… America’s military and military service people, calling-

Bret Baier :
Critics say-

Kamala Harris :
… them suckers and losers.

Bret Baier :
… that it goes to Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis.

Kamala Harris :
Has diminished the significance-

Bret Baier :
We’re talking over each other, I apologize.

Kamala Harris :
Well, and I wish-

Bret Baier :
But you’re not-

Kamala Harris :
I would like that we would have a conversation that is grounded in full assessment of the facts, which includes, I think this interview is supposed to be about the choices that your viewers should be presented about this election and the contrast is important.

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma’am. And we-

Kamala Harris :
And on this subject of Iran, I am offering what should be an important contrast that is presented for folks to make a decision that they feel-

Bret Baier :
And there are critics who look at what the administration did and think differently. Madam Vice President, they’re wrapping me very hard here. I hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump. There are a lot of things-

Kamala Harris :
There’s more to say. I have much more to say, actually.

Bret Baier :
There are a lot of things that people want to learn about you and your policies.

Kamala Harris :
Yes,

Bret Baier :
And that’s why we invited you her.

Kamala Harris :
I invite everyone to go to KamalaHarris.com and you will see that I have 80 pages of policies that are quite comprehensive and should be accessible to anyone who would like to read them. And it includes what I intend to do about affordable housing, what I intend to do about small businesses, what I intend to do to-

Bret Baier :
And that’s why we invited you here.

Kamala Harris :
… strengthen our economy.

Bret Baier :
To see where you were in 2019 and where you are now.

Kamala Harris :
To support America’s military and ensure we have the most lethal and best fighting force in the world.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, they’re giving me a hard wrap here.

Kamala Harris :
Well, I thank you for the time.

Bret Baier :
I thank you for the time.

Kamala Harris :
It’s good to meet you.

Bret Baier :
Thank you very much.

Kamala Harris :
Thank you.

Bret Baier: Madam Vice President, thank you for the time.

Kamala Harris:
Thank you. It’s good to be with you, Bret.

Bret Baier:
Voters tell pollsters all over the country and here in Pennsylvania that immigration is one of the key issues that they’re looking at this election and specifically the influx of illegal immigrants from more than 150 countries. How many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released into the country over the last three-and-half years?

Kamala Harris:
Well, I’m glad you raised the issue of immigration because I agree with you. It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have and you know what I’m going to talk about right now, which is-

Bret Baier :
Yeah, but just a number. Do you think’s 1 million? 3 million?

Kamala Harris :
Bret, let’s just get to the point. Okay. The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired.

Bret Baier :
Your Homeland Security secretary said that 85% of apprehensions-

Kamala Harris :
But I’m not finished, I’m not finished. We have an immigration system-

Bret Baier :
It’s a rough estimate of 6 million-

Kamala Harris : 
… that needs to be…

Bret Baier :
… people have been released into the country. And let me just finish. I’ll get to the question, I promise you.

Kamala Harris :
I was beginning to answer.

Bret Baier :
And when you came into office, your administration immediately reversed a number of Trump border policies, most significantly, the policy that required illegal immigrants to be detained through deportation either in the US or in Mexico. And you switched that policy, they were released from custody awaiting trial. So instead, included in those were a large number of single men, adult men who went on to commit heinous crimes. So looking back, do you regret the decision to terminate remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration?

Kamala Harris :
At the beginning of our administration, within practically hours of taking the oath, the first bill that we offered Congress, before we worked on infrastructure, before the Inflation Reduction Act, before the Chips and Science Act, before the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first bill, practically within hours of taking the oath, was a bill to fix our immigration system.

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma’am. It was called the US Citizenship Act of 2021.

Kamala Harris :
Exactly.

Bret Baier :
It was essentially a pathway to citizenship for the-

Kamala Harris :
May I please finish?

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma’am.

Kamala Harris :
May I finish responding please?

Bret Baier :
But here, but this-

Kamala Harris :
But you have to let me finish, please.

Bret Baier :
You had the White House and the House and the Senate and they didn’t bring up that bill.

Kamala Harris :
I’m in the middle responding to the point you’re raising.

Bret Baier :
Okay.

Kamala Harris :
And I’d like to finish.

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma’am.

Kamala Harris :
We recognized from day one that to the point of this being your first question, it is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people. And our focus has been on fixing a problem. And from day one then, we have done a number of things, including to address our asylum system and put more resources, getting more judges, what we needed to do to tighten up penalties and increase penalties for illegal crossings, what we needed to do to deal with points of entry between border entry points. That’s the work we did.And we worked on supporting what was a bipartisan effort, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, to actually strengthen the border. That border bill would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border, which is why I believe the border patrol agents supported the bill. It would’ve allowed us to stem the flow of fentanyl coming into the United States, which is a scourge affecting people of every background, every geographic location in our country, killing people. It would’ve allowed us to put more resources into prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, which I have done-

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma’am

Kamala Harris :
… as the attorney general, former attorney general of a border state.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, a couple things.

Kamala Harris :
Prosecuted trafficking of drugs, guns, and human beings. And Donald Trump-

Bret Baier :
Six Democrats-

Kamala Harris :
But let me just finish. And Donald Trump-

Bret Baier :
Six Democrats voted against that bill.

Kamala Harris :
… learned about that bill and told them to kill it because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. And in this election, this is rightly a discussion that the American people want to have and what they want are solutions and they want a president of the United States who’s not playing political games with the issue-

Bret Baier :
I hear you.

Kamala Harris :
… but actually is focused on fixing it.

Bret Baier :
Six Democrats voted against that bill. It would’ve allowed 1.8 million illegal immigrants into the country a year. A lot of conservatives had a problem with it. These are the six Democrats. But more importantly, back to the original premise, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were released at the beginning of the administration, well before a negotiated bipartisan bill. Former President Clinton actually referred to Laken Riley Sunday, campaigning for you in Georgia, saying if those men had been properly vetted, Laken Riley probably would not have been killed.So it wouldn’t have happened. This is well before any negotiation. This is well before Donald Trump got involved in the politics. This is a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country. So what I’m saying to you, do you-

Kamala Harris :
No, no, Bret. I think it’s really-

Bret Baier :
… owe those families an apology?

Kamala Harris :
Let me just say, first of all, those are tragic cases. There’s no question about that. There is no question about that and I can’t imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. So that is true. It is also true that if a border security had actually been passed nine months ago, it would be nine months that we would’ve had more border agents at the border, more support for the folks who are working around the clock trying to hold it all together-

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
… to ensure that no future harm would occur. And this election in 20 days will determine whether we have a president of the United States who actually cares more about fixing a problem even if it is not to their political advantage in an election, because there was a solution, Bret.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, it was a policy decision in the early part of your administration. I will let one of the mothers talk about it. Take a listen.

Speaker 3 (mother of victim) :
“Because of the Biden-Harris administration open border policy’s catch and release, they were enrolled in the alternatives to detention program. This meant that they were released into the United States. It was not even a full three weeks later that they would take my daughter, Jocelyn Nungaray’s life. I believe the Biden-Harris administration open border policies are responsible for the death of my daughter”

Bret Baier :
That’s the early days. So do you owe them an apology? Is what I’m saying.

Kamala Harris :
I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. I’m so sorry for her loss, sincerely. But let’s talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions. Let’s talk about that as well, Bret.

Bret Baier :
But do you want to answer her?

Kamala Harris :
In all fairness. I told you I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.

Bret Baier :
During that time, you said repeatedly that the border was secure. When in your mind did it start becoming a crisis?

Kamala Harris :
I think we’ve had a broken immigration system transcending, by the way, Donald Trump’s administration, even before. Let’s all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system. I’ve been clear, I think we all are, that it needs to be fixed. We need more…I was just down at the border, talking with border agents and they will tell you, and I’m sure you probably, I know you investigate and you are a serious journalist, they will tell you we need more judges. We need to process those cases faster. We need the support for those cases that should be prosecuted. They need more resources and Congress ultimately is the only place that that’s going to get fixed, Bret. That’s how the system works.

Bret Baier :
That’s the premise of this question.

Kamala Harris :
But that’s how the system works.

Bret Baier :
There were 90 plus executive orders that were rescinded in the first days. Many of those were Trump border policies. I’m not going to stay here because there’s other things to talk about, but you frequently talked to the Border Patrol Union for support of that bipartisan bill and they did. They supported it, but they also just endorsed Donald Trump and said you’ve been “a failure with border security.” Why do you think they said that?

Kamala Harris :
I think they’re frustrated and I get it. They want support. They want support, and that’s what that border security bill would’ve done. These guys down at the border, these men and women, they’re working hard. They’re working around the clock. I get it.

Bret Baier :
There’s a lot of people that look back at what you said in 2019 when you first ran for president. And there have been changes and you’ve talked about some of them. When it comes to immigration, you supported allowing immigrants in the country illegally to apply for driver’s license, to qualify for free tuition at universities, to be enrolled in free healthcare. Do you still support those things?

Kamala Harris :
Listen, that was five years ago and I’m very clear that I will follow the law. I have made that statement over and over again and as vice president of the United States, that’s exactly what I’ve done, not to mention before.

Bret Baier :
If that’s the case, you chose a running mate, Tim Walz, governor of Minnesota, who signed those very things into state law. So do you support that?

Kamala Harris :
We are very clear and I am very clear, as is Tim Walz, that we must support and enforce federal law and that is exactly what we will do.

Bret Baier :
Decriminalizing border crossings, like you said in 2019-

Kamala Harris :
I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings and I’ve not done that as vice president. I will not do that as president.

Bret Baier :
So these are evolutions that you’ve had.

Kamala Harris :
Well, let’s be very clear. I’m the only person who’s running for president who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations, from the Sinaloa Cartel, to the Guadalajara Cartel, to people who have trafficked in guns, drugs and human beings. I have spent a significant part of my career going after people who present a threat to the safety of the American people and cross our border with the intent of doing us harm and cross our border illegally. And I will do that work as vice president, I take that work quite seriously.

Bret Baier :
This is a time when voters, especially here in Pennsylvania, are inundated with commercials and ads. They just want it to stop because it’s every commercial. But many of them add noise, but a few of them seem to break through. This particular one from the Trump campaign has gotten a lot of attention.

Speaker 4 (Trump Ad) :
Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.
Kamala Harris (Trump Ad) :
“For prisoners. Every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access”

Bret Baier :
So are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender?

Kamala Harris :
I will follow the law and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You’re probably familiar with now it’s a public report that under Donald Trump’s administration, these surgeries were available to, on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system. And I think frankly, that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing stones when you’re living in a glass house.

Bret Baier :
The Trump aides say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition surgeries happened during his presidency.

Kamala Harris :
Well, you got to take responsible for what happened in your administration.

Bret Baier :
Yeah, no surgeries happened in his presidency.

Kamala Harris :
It’s in black and white.

Bret Baier :
Would you still advocate for using taxpayer dollars for gender reassignment surgeries?

Kamala Harris :
I would follow the law, just as-

Bret Baier :
Well, you have a say in as-

Kamala Harris :
… I think Donald Trump would say he did.

Bret Baier :
You would have a say as president.

Kamala Harris :
Like I said, I think it’s… He spent $20 million on those ads trying to create a sense of fear in the voters because he actually has no plan in this election that is about focusing on the needs of the American people. Whereas $20 million on that ad, on an issue that, as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American people, it’s really quite remote. And again, his policy was no different. Look at where we are though.

Bret Baier :
They say it was different, but let’s, we’ll move on.

Kamala Harris :
On plans for the American people, I’m offering a plan to deal with affordable housing. I’m offering a plan to deal with what we need to do to strengthen small businesses which are the backbone of America’s economy. I am offering a plan that is about taking care of young parents and giving them the support they need. My plans for the economy will strengthen the economy, as have been reviewed by 16 Nobel Laureates, Goldman Sachs, Moody’s, and recently the Wall Street Journal, which have all studied our plans and have indicated my plans for our economy would strengthen our economy. His would make them weaker, would ignite-

Bret Baier :
Why do you think more people say-

Kamala Harris :
… inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. Those are the facts.

Bret Baier :
Why do you think more people say they trust him on the economy than they trust you?

Kamala Harris :
I think that when you look at an analysis of our plans for what we would do as president of the United States, it has been clear to those who study and understand how economic policy works that moving forward, because I do believe the American people are ready to turn the page on the divisiveness and the type of rhetoric that has come out of Donald Trump, people are ready to chart a new way forward and they want a president who has a plan for the future and a plan that is sound and will strengthen our country. My plan for the economy does exactly that. His plan would be again to give tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations in our country and blow up our deficit.

Bret Baier :
It’s interesting you said turn the page, Madam Vice President. You were asked on two different shows last week, what, if anything, you would do differently than President Biden? Here’s what you said.

Speaker 6 (prior interview) :
Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
Kamala Harris (prior interview) :
“There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of… And I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact”
Stephen Colbert (prior interview) :
Under a Harris administration, what would the major changes be? And what would stay the same?
Kamala Harris (prior interview) :
“Sure. Well, I’m obviously not Joe Biden”
Stephen Colbert (prior interview) :
I noticed. 
Kamala Harris (prior interview) :
“So that would be one change in terms of… But also, I think it’s important to say with 28 days to go, I’m not Donald Trump”

Bret Baier :
So you’re not Joe Biden, you’re not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently?

Kamala Harris :
Let me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency. And like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership.I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington D.C. I invite ideas, whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting me, who were just on stage with me minutes ago, and the business sector and others who can contribute to the decisions that I make about, for example, my plan for increasing the supply of housing in America and bringing down the cost of housing, addressing the issue of small businesses, which is about working with the private sector to bring more capital and access to capital to our small business leaders, including my plan for a $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time home buyers and for small businesses, extending the tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000.

Bret Baier :
We’ve heard a lot about those plans in recent days. Your campaign slogan is a new way forward and it’s time to turn the page. You’ve been vice president for three and a half years, so what are you turning the page from?

Kamala Harris :
Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. Rhetoric and an approach to leadership that suggests that the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down instead of what we all know, the strength of leadership is based on who you lift up.

Bret Baier :
But you, Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
The strength of an American president, which is one who understands that the vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. That is turning the page-

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, more than 70% of people tell pollsters-

Kamala Harris :
That is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of, Bret. People are exhausted.

Bret Baier :
More than 70% of people tell the country is on the wrong track. They say the country is on the wrong track. If it’s on the wrong track, that track follows three and a half years of you being vice president and President Biden being president. That is what they’re saying, 79% of them. Why are they saying that? If you’re turning the page, you’ve been in office for three and a half years.

Kamala Harris :
And Donald Trump has been running for office since-

Bret Baier :
But you’ve been the person holding the office.

Kamala Harris :
Come on, come on.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
You and I both know what I’m talking about. You and I both know what I’m talking about.

Bret Baier :
I actually don’t. What are you talking about?

Kamala Harris :
What I’m talking about is that over the last decade, people have become-

Bret Baier :
But you’re the lever of power.

Kamala Harris :
But listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me and certainly the Republicans who are on stage with me, the former chief of staff to the President Donald Trump, former defense secretaries, national security adviser and his vice president, one, that he is unfit to serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous, and that people are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader who spends full-time demeaning and engaging in personal grievances and it being about him instead of-

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President-

Kamala Harris :
… instead the American people.

Bret Baier :
… if that’s the case-

Kamala Harris :
People are tired of that.

Bret Baier :
If that’s the case, why is half the country supporting him? Why is he beating you in a lot of swing states? Why, if he’s as bad as you say, that half of this country is now supporting this person who could be the 47th president of the United States? Why is that happening?

Kamala Harris :
This is an election for president of the United States. It’s not supposed to be easy.

Bret Baier :
I know, but it is-

Kamala Harris :
It is not supposed to be a cakewalk for anyone.

Bret Baier :
So are they misguided, the 50%?

Kamala Harris :
Listen, let-

Bret Baier :
Are they stupid? What is it?

Kamala Harris :
Oh, God. I would never say that about the American people. And in fact, if you listen to Donald Trump, if you watch any of his rallies, he’s the one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people. He’s the one who talks about an enemy within, an enemy within, talking about the American people, suggesting he would turn the American military on the American people.

Bret Baier :
We asked that question to the former president today. Harris Faulkner had a town hall and this is how he responded.

“I heard about that. They were saying I was threatening. I’m not threatening anybody. They’re the ones doing the threatening. They do phony investigations. I’ve been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. He was the greatest gangster-“

And this is what is at stake, which is why you have someone like the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff saying what Mark Milley has said about Donald Trump being a threat to the United States of America.

Bret Baier :
He’s quoted in the Bob Woodward book that way, yes. Let me ask you this, Madam Vice President.

Kamala Harris :
But let’s not-

Bret Baier :
You call Donald Trump-

Kamala Harris :
… diminish the significance of that.

Bret Baier :
You call Donald Trump, he’s misguided. You say now he’s-

Kamala Harris :
He’s unstable.

Bret Baier :
… unstable.

Kamala Harris :
He is unstable, Bret.

Bret Baier :
He’s not well, you say he is mentally not stable.

Kamala Harris :
He’s not stable.

Bret Baier :
Let me ask you this.

Kamala Harris :
And we should all be concerned.

Bret Baier :
You told many interviewers that Joe Biden was on his game, that ran around circles on his staff. When did you first notice that President Biden’s mental faculties appeared diminished?

Kamala Harris :
Joe Biden, I have watched in from the Oval Office to the situation room, and he has the judgment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people. Joe Biden-

Bret Baier :
There were no concerns raised?

Kamala Harris :
Bret, Joe Biden is not on ballot.

Bret Baier :
I understand, but-

Kamala Harris :
And Donald Trump is-

Bret Baier :
But you talked about it.

Kamala Harris :
And Donald Trump is.

Bret Baier :
After George Clooney said within a few minutes of-

Kamala Harris :
And if you watch Donald Trump-

Bret Baier :
… talking to President Biden at a fundraiser, that he thought this was not the same Joe Biden that we saw on the debate stage.

Kamala Harris :
Donald Trump is on the ballot.

Bret Baier :
I understand. You met with him at least once a week for three and a half years. You didn’t have any concerns?

Kamala Harris :
I think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump, which is why the people who know him best, including leaders of our national security community, have all spoken out. Even people who worked for him in the Oval Office, worked with him in the situation room, and have said he is unfit and dangerous and should never be president of the United States again, including his former vice president, which is why the job was open for him to choose another running mate. So that is a fact. That is a fact.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, two more things. You were asked on 60 Minutes about the biggest threat that the world faces, that the US faces. This is what you said.

Bill Whitaker (prior interview) :
Which foreign country do you consider to be our greatest adversary?
Kamala Harris (prior interview):
I think there’s an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands. Okay? This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities.

Bret Baier :
A number of experts thought you would say China, the FBI director had said that, but you said Iran. If that’s the case, what do you say to critics who look at the actions of your administration and say you’re not acting like Iran is the number one threat?

Kamala Harris :
Well, I will tell you most recently, whether it was in April or in October, and then several hours on each occasion, that Iran posed a threat to Israel. I was there, most recently in the situation room in the most recent attack, working with the heads of our military in doing what America must always do to defend and to support Israel in its requirement to defend itself and to give American support, to be able to allow Israel to have the resources to defend itself against attack, including from Iran and Iran’s terrorist proxies in the region.

Bret Baier :
Right.

Kamala Harris :
And that is-

Bret Baier :
But those proxies were getting funded by Iran.

Kamala Harris :
And my commitment to that is unyielding and unwavering.

Bret Baier :
Critics just say that you either relaxed or failed to enforce sanctions on Iran, allowing all of this money to flow into Iran, like billions in oil profits.

Kamala Harris :
But let’s go back to Donald Trump, who-

Bret Baier :
Hold on, that-

Kamala Harris :
… pulled out of a deal that would’ve actually put Iran in check.

Bret Baier :
The estimate’s in billions.

Kamala Harris :
And then it was during Donald Trump’s administration that Iran-

Bret Baier :
… that go towards the Iran regime.

Kamala Harris :
That we had an American military base that was attacked, where American soldiers suffered traumatic brain injuries and Donald Trump dismissed them as headaches. Not to mention how Donald Trump has-

Bret Baier :
Madame Vice President, all of this money-

Kamala Harris :
… treated and talked about-

Bret Baier :
… that has gone in the past few years-

Kamala Harris :
… America’s military and military service people, calling-

Bret Baier :
Critics say-

Kamala Harris :
… them suckers and losers.

Bret Baier :
… that it goes to Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis.

Kamala Harris :
Has diminished the significance-

Bret Baier :
We’re talking over each other, I apologize.

Kamala Harris :
Well, and I wish-

Bret Baier :
But you’re not-

Kamala Harris :
I would like that we would have a conversation that is grounded in full assessment of the facts, which includes, I think this interview is supposed to be about the choices that your viewers should be presented about this election and the contrast is important.

Bret Baier :
Yes, ma’am. And we-

Kamala Harris :
And on this subject of Iran, I am offering what should be an important contrast that is presented for folks to make a decision that they feel-

Bret Baier :
And there are critics who look at what the administration did and think differently. Madam Vice President, they’re wrapping me very hard here. I hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump. There are a lot of things-

Kamala Harris :
There’s more to say. I have much more to say, actually.

Bret Baier :
There are a lot of things that people want to learn about you and your policies.

Kamala Harris :
Yes,

Bret Baier :
And that’s why we invited you her.

Kamala Harris :
I invite everyone to go to KamalaHarris.com and you will see that I have 80 pages of policies that are quite comprehensive and should be accessible to anyone who would like to read them. And it includes what I intend to do about affordable housing, what I intend to do about small businesses, what I intend to do to-

Bret Baier :
And that’s why we invited you here.

Kamala Harris :
… strengthen our economy.

Bret Baier :
To see where you were in 2019 and where you are now.

Kamala Harris :
To support America’s military and ensure we have the most lethal and best fighting force in the world.

Bret Baier :
Madam Vice President, they’re giving me a hard wrap here.

Kamala Harris :
Well, I thank you for the time.

Bret Baier :
I thank you for the time.

Kamala Harris :
It’s good to meet you.

Bret Baier :
Thank you very much.

Kamala Harris :
Thank you.

"The District of Columbia, the capital city and seat of government for the United States, contains a population of roughly 700,000 in a condensed area of sixty square miles. That population has remained steady over the post-war decades as the reach of the capital city has expanded outward into adjacent counties in Maryland and Virginia.


Everyone who has seen the musical Hamilton knows that the nation’s capital was moved to the present site in the District of Columbia due to a dinner-table bargain in 1790 between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Hamilton needed Jefferson’s support in Congress to win approval for the federal assumption of Revolutionary War debts; in return, Jefferson wanted Hamilton’s support to move the capital from New York City to a location nearer to the population and geographical center of the country, later mapped out by President Washington in a district between Maryland and Virginia.


The capital city increasingly directs the voters rather than being controlled by them. After all, government operates continuously, with influential decisions made on a day-to-day basis, while voters show up at the polls episodically every two or four years. The range and scale of operations in the capital are now so vast that voters can have little hope of controlling or even understanding them. Notwithstanding its alliance with the Democrats, the capital has developed into a kind of political party in its own right.


Voters across the country appear to have a rough sense of the degree to which influence has been concentrated in the capital, often in opposition to their wishes or interests. Donald Trump’s supporters, gathered at his rallies, called upon him to “drain the swamp,” a reference to the widespread corruption they saw taking place in Washington. It did not take long after Trump’s election in 2016 for several government agencies, including the fbi, cia, and Department of Justice, to come forward with a campaign to drive him from office, or distract him with so many investigations as to make it difficult for him to address the concerns that animated his voters. This was the “deep state,” as he and his supporters called it, another layer of influence burrowed inside the government, operating through clandestine avenues to discredit threats to what they regarded as the national interest.

Kamala Harris hasn't really given a clear explanation of what she'll do differently and I don't want a repeat of the last four years, so this election I'm voting for policy, and I'm voting for Trump. Though I would love to see a woman president, I really don't want a repeat of the last four years. Not to mention the many other issues that this administration has caused.

"I was just reflecting on the fact that this was my 7th time voting in a presidential election. (I was too young to vote in 1996 by a couple weeks.) It’s not hyperbole to say Harris is the worst candidate the Democrats have ever offered during that time. We’re days away from the election, and she still can’t answer basic layup questions about her priorities. To the extent she’s offered any policy specifics (capital gains tax) they’ve been provably bad ideas. She also has no charm. All she can run on is baseless fear-mongering. 

Meanwhile, Trump, imperfect as he may be, is offering a team that includes Vance, Musk, RFK Jr., Gabbard and Ramaswamy. Because of that, this was the most enthusiastic I’d ever been to vote. I’m excited by the prospect that we might actually slash federal bureaucracy, get the deficit under control, bring manufacturing (and all the related industries and services) back to the U.S., and fight evil corporate forces that are poisoning us. These are the great issues of our time, along with stopping the invasion at our Southern border.

We have to win. A popular vote victory would be the cherry on top. Please vote (in person if possible), even if you’re not in a swing state.

As the American people have grown accustomed to, the lapdog mainstream media has failed again and again to give President Trump credit for so many of his historic achievements in his first term — chief among them what he has accomplished for women. 

During his first term, President Trump surrounded himself with strong female leaders while enacting historic pro-women policies including a booming economy, safer communities and stronger pro-family policies.

He empowered strong, intelligent women leaders in his campaigns and administration.
