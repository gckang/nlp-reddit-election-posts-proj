How the GW Bush administration impoverished America and created the MAGA movement.

After World War II, high-school educated Americans manufactured everything for the rest of the world.   Middle class wealth exploded upward.  A high-school educated guy could support a family of four with excellent health care and a lifelong pension.  Middle class suburbs were built all over the country.  We had the best bridges and highways and airports in the world. 

GW Bush destroyed the middle class by moving our manufacturing jobs to China:

**“When a good or service is produced at lower cost in another country, it makes sense to import it rather than to produce it domestically.”** —Economic Report of the President \[GW Bush\], p. 25, February 2004

**“Outsourcing is just a new way of doing international trade. More things are tradable than were tradable in the past. And that’s a good thing.”** —N. Gregory Mankiw, Chairman of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisors, Feb. 9, 2004

**The outsourcing of U.S. jobs “is part of trade... and there can’t be any doubt about the fact that trade makes the economy stronger.”** —U.S. Treasury Secretary \[under GW Bush\] John Snow, March 29, 2004

My comfortable programming job (which I was proud of) went to India and I almost starved.

Now an American with a BA degree lives 8.5 years longer than a high-school educated American.   

**THAT’S WHY WE HAVE THE MAGA MOVEMENT.**

Then GW Bush protected the Homeland by lying us into a war which was financed by stealing $8,000,000,000,000 from Social Security.  After sending 7,000 American troops to their deaths and displacing 34,000,000 middle easterners and starting a war between the Sunnis and Shias that’s still going on and raising the price of oil to new highs, GW Bush prevented government agencies from looking into what went wrong.

Then GW Bush decided that the banks shouldn’t be held in check by government regulations, and he crashed stock markets all over the world.  People in America and all over the world lost their life savings.  Then GW Bush bailed out the criminally incompetent banks that caused the mess with American taxpayer dollars.  The bankers got rewarded.  On top of all that, he increased the U.S. debt by $1,207,189,695,334.34.

**THAT’S WHY WE HAVE THE MAGA MOVEMENT.**

The job would be impossible without immunity (immunity that is limited to what is in the scope of their job - leading an insurrection to stay in power is not part of a President's job). 

During the run-up to the Iraq war, I was vocally against invading. UN weapons inspectors were searching for WMD and finding nothing, but Bush and company were claiming they had intelligence that said otherwise. Despite the fact that it looked to everyone else that Bush was lying, he was certainly seeing intelligence information that I wasn't, so how could I claim to know better than him, in the situation? In hindsight I and everyone else that thought he was lying was right, but that still doesn't mean that he should be prosecuted. Even if he was lying about his justification, if he believed it was in the nation's best interests to invade, prosecution after his presidency is not the solution (impeachment and conviction is).

"The framers of the Constitution didn’t even think it was a good idea for all Americans to vote. 

The idea that all Americans should have the right to vote began to gain significant traction in the early 19th century, evolving over time through various social and political movements. This concept is deeply tied to the expansion of suffrage and the efforts to ensure that voting rights were extended to broader segments of the population.

1. Early 19th Century - Jacksonian Democracy: One of the early champions of expanded suffrage was President Andrew Jackson. His election in 1828 was a result of the growing movement towards more inclusive voting rights for white men. Jacksonian Democracy advocated for the elimination of property requirements for voting, which significantly expanded the electorate to include all white men, not just property owners. This was a substantial shift from the earlier restrictions that limited voting rights to landowners and the wealthy.

2. Abolitionist Movement and Reconstruction (Mid-19th century): The abolitionist movement, with figures like Frederick Douglass, linked the fight against slavery to broader civil rights, including suffrage for African Americans. After the Civil War, during the Reconstruction era, significant strides were made with the passage of the 15th Amendment in 1870, which prohibited denying the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. However, enforcement was uneven and often violently resisted, especially in the South.

3. Women's Suffrage Movement (Late 19th to Early 20th Century): The women’s suffrage movement worked tirelessly for the right of women to vote, culminating in the 19th Amendment in 1920, which prohibited denying the right to vote based on sex. This was a pivotal moment in the expansion of voting rights in the United States.

4. Civil Rights Movement (Mid-20th Century): The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s was crucial in the fight for voting rights for African Americans, particularly in the South. The efforts led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which aimed to eliminate barriers to voting such as literacy tests and poll taxes. This Act was instrumental in ensuring that African Americans could exercise their right to vote.

5. Other Expansions (Late 20th Century): The 26th Amendment, ratified in 1971, lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, expanding suffrage to millions of young Americans, driven largely by the context of the Vietnam War and the argument that those old enough to be drafted should also have the right to vote. 

Throughout American history, various individuals and groups championed the cause of expanded suffrage. Their combined efforts over centuries helped to establish the idea that all Americans should have the right to vote, regardless of property ownership, race, sex, or age. This ongoing struggle reflects the evolving nature of American democracy and the continuous effort to make it more inclusive.",1717250414,8,democrats

With respect to Bush's contemporaneous knowledge of the Affairs, Walsh deposed him on January 11, 1988. After he was elected president, however, it became more difficult to interview him again, as Walsh had hoped to do. Indeed, Bush refused to speak about anything but his failure to produce his diary and notes, terms Walsh rejected. Since Bush was the sitting president, and because criminal prosecution was deemed unlikely, Walsh did not subpoena him.

However, in his final report, Walsh identified a number of issues about which he hoped to question Bush, areas in which evidence seemed to conflict with his previous testimony. These issues included his knowledge of Israeli arms sales to Iran, his 1986 meeting with Israeli official Amiram Nir, his knowledge of quid-pro-quo dealings with countries that pledged to support the Contras, and his and Vice Presidential National Security Adviser Donald Gregg's meetings with National Security Council staff member Oliver North.

Widely believing a vengeful Mr. Trump poses a grave threat to the nation, Democrats at all levels of the party are simultaneously thrilled to see him found guilty and fearful that he has a supernatural ability to survive even this political peril.

Post-verdict interviews with more than 50 Democrats — including current and former members of Congress, statewide elected officials, veteran strategists, Democratic National Committee members and local officials — revealed a party hungry to tell voters that Mr. Trump’s conviction makes him unfit and worried that Mr. Biden might not use the bully pulpit of the presidency to press that argument.""",1717338711,9,democrats

If they voluntarily chose another candidate it is very unlikely that they could win, due to poor voter turnout. Choosing Trump they are very unlikely to pick up more than 1-2% of uncommitted voters.
The ironic thing is that if they had a young, attractive, non-felonious candidate they almost certainly could have won. Their platform could have been ""abolish Social Security and Medicare and let old people die, give millionaires tax cuts and quadruple taxes paid by the poor and working class, close public schools and only allow religious and charter schools, nuke whatever country, deport anyone not in the US for three generations, get rid of lgbtq+ people, and stop all environmental and climate change regulations"" and they still would have won. 

Biden has done more for the working class and poor people than any president since LBJ/Kennedy, has done the most work on climate change of any president (not a high bar), has kept Russia contained in Ukraine for pennies on the dollar of what a spillover into Transnistria or the Baltic states would have cost, has done the best he could balancing AIPAC and the Israel lobby against even more war crimes, been the first president to walk a picket line, and kept the economy humming in spite of greedflation and petro state collusion to ramp up inflation.

"The way government is currently constructed, if we saw a need to do it and could get some bipartisan support (We're in the minority in the US House, where the legislation would need to be brought to the floor and pass, even though we have the Senate and the White House.  After this next election, we'll probably have the House and not the Senate \[Long story, but ask any political analyst.  It's not a certainty, but it's definitely a reality-based opinion, as odd as it sounds to think that the two major parties might essentially just swap chambers as the result of an election rather than losing or gaining ground in both\], which could basically mean the same thing.), we'd need to whittle around the edges.

For example, we could raise the MPG requirements on new cars and trucks (My personal opinion is that it is usually better not to do anything that touches vehicles people already own that go beyond existing state emissions standards.  That's too intrusive and backfires politically.  Going to the car manufacturers and saying ""This is how new cars and trucks should be in terms of fuel efficiency"" or whatever is a little easier and a lighter hand.  My fellow Democrats do not universally agree with me on that, admittedly.  Like I said, personal opinion. :) ).  

A light truck, presumably, will get better mileage than a heavy truck.  If the goal were to specifically encourage light trucks over heavy trucks, we could in theory merge the categories into a single one called ""trucks"" and have them all have the same hypothetical new tougher MPG policy category.  This would naturally move the truck market to lighter trucks for obvious reasons.  Very hard to make a heavy truck fuel efficient, I would imagine (I don't know much about cars, though I do drive one.).

The other thing we could do is tax credits on fuel efficient vehicles.  These are already in place for some electric cars and I think the party would like to do more (Although we're not a monolith).  Do they make electric light trucks?  Is it reasonable to think that someone *could* with present day technology and they just choose not to, or is it more like even a light truck needs x amount of horsepower and electric can't power that?

There are other things that could be done as well.  No one is stupid enough politically to try to kill the heavy truck outright and mandate everyone switch over to light trucks.  However, there are a lot of little things that can be done to incentivize people to voluntarily choose correctly more often than they would if not incentivized- like tax credits.  And stuff that sets the market- like stricter emissions standards on new vehicles and the way we classify them.  I mean, basically you can see I only had the two ideas off the top of my head. :)  But hopefully you can also see the type of ideas I think might work based on them- like I do feel like they fall under categories, I'm just drawing blanks on what to call them. :)

I tend if it ever got to the point of someone introducing a bill, it'd be smart to do a study first to determine if light truck users are people who would otherwise be driving cars, or who would otherwise be driving heavy trucks.  Because moving people from cars to light trucks sounds like the opposite of what we're trying to do global climate change wise.  Moving people from heavy trucks to light trucks, on the other hand... I do think people would see that as the correct direction.  So, we'd want to be sure what we're doing, exactly. :)

I've been talking about the normal legislative process, but of course executive orders to do certain things are also possibilities, though as folks know, the next President can come in and change them all without Congressional approval.  Also, executive orders are frequently subject to court challenges, or at least people trying to bring them.

As for Trump’s ongoing attacks on the judicial system and elections as “rigged,” Biden said: “Nothing could be more dangerous for the country, more dangerous for American democracy.”

"No. An EO can't override the Constitution, which lays out the requirements for a President: a natural-born citizen, at least 35 years old, and a US resident for at least 14 years.

And since Trump currently doesn't hold office, he can't be impeached or convicted, nor would there be enough votes for that currently, since it require a 2/3rds majority to convict.

The 14th amendment does bar a previously elected official, who has previously sworn to uphold the Constitution, from holding office if they have ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion ... or given aid or comfort to the enemies [of the US].""

The problem with that is it can't really bar them from *running* for office, for various reasons, including that Congress can choose to override that clause with a 2/3rds vote.

If Trump *were* elected, a suit could be brought challenging his eligibility to hold office under the 14th Amendment - but the catch there is the case would be decided by the Supreme Court, which is extremely friendly to conservatives right now. There seems like a pretty high likelihood that they'd rule that Trump did not engage in insurrection, or come up with some other excuse.

"> I think Comey completely screwed Hillary with his October surprise announcement. I’d caution calling him a democrat. He *gave* us Trump.

Comey was definitely a Democrat operative (though at the time he claimed to be a Republican.  He didn't leave the party until after he tried to overthrow Trump's Presidency and got caught).

As to Comey's October Surprise announcement, he didn't have much choice.  Comey wrote the statement exonerating Clinton seven months before he gave it on national TV, and long before the investigation was seriously underway.  Peter Strzok changed the wording in that statement so that it no longer called her behavior ""grossly negligent"" (which happens to be the standard for the statute that Comey was exonerating her on), and instead called it ""extremely careless"".

After Congress subpoenaed Hillary's emails and she illegally had the server wiped in response, the only way they were able to find out what was on the server was to get the recipients of her emails to send anything that they had been copied on.  Since the lefties in the Federal government did not want to cooperate, the investigation naturally got a very incomplete set of emails.  It was that incomplete set that Comey originally exonerated Hillary for on the basis that she didn't *intend* to send thousands of classified documents over an unclassified network.  Never mind that the statute doesn't require intent, you aren't supposed to know that.  You also aren't supposed to know about all the *other* felonies she committed, like having her staff remove the cover pages from classified documents so they could be sent over unclassified networks, or deliberately sending classified information to people who had been explicitly denied a security clearance, or having her IT guy (who was not cleared to see classified information) print out the classified emails and bring them to her.  All of that was water under the bridge, thanks to Comey's July 2016 statement, and she had clear sailing to the election.

There was just one problem.  In NYC, the NY Field Office was busy investigating former Rep. Anthony Wiener for sexting with a 15 year old girl.  They got his laptop and discovered something unexpected: hundreds of thousands of emails from Hillary's private email server - a much more complete copy than Congress had.  It turns out that Wiener was married to Huma Abedin, Hillary's top aide - and she had sent a copy of all Hillary's emails to Wiener's laptop - which included hundreds of thousands of emails subpoenaed by Congress that Hillary had deleted and Congress hadn't been able to recover.  The NY Field Office reported this to FBI HQ in DC and... nothing.  30 days went by.  Then 60.  Finally the NY Field Office issued an ultimatum: Either the DC FBI inform Congress of the emails, or the NY Field Office would.  That forced Comey's hand, which is why he made the announcement that the investigation had been re-opened.

Strzok (there's that name again) was given the task of examining the 400,000 new emails for classified emails, and voila!  Two weeks later, Strzok reported that the metadata of all the emails had been examined and that the emails were just more copies of what they already had, and no new classified emails had been recovered.

Turns out that was not one, not two, but three lies.

1. He couldn't process the emails using the metadata because the metadata was corrupt.

2. Because the metadata was corrupt, all of the emails had to be individually examined.  ...and only 3000 of the 400,000 emails were examined during those two weeks.

3. More than a dozen previously unknown classified emails were discovered among those 3000.

So, Comey made his *second* statement exonerating Clinton, which was just as much of a lie as the first one.

A few honest men threw a wrench into Comey's plan to make the classified emails go away, but he did the best he could.",1717204886,-2,Republican
"Well, for one thing we know Biden spent decades stealing classified documents he could never have legally possessed as a Senator.  He'd have had to sneak them out of a Secure Classified Information Facility.  Not once or twice, but thousands of times.

Bank records show he was taking bribes from China, and there are accusations from people involved that he took bribes from Ukraine as well.

Based on the above and the 1974 video of him talking about how as a new Senator he went around to all the moneyed interests trying to sell his influence, it is likely he was selling classified information for decades.

"I get where you're coming from with your concerns about the Biden administration’s policy on terminating some asylum cases without a decision. It seems like this approach could let migrants stay in the U.S. without accountability, which does feel like a form of amnesty. This policy could lead to a lack of oversight because these individuals are no longer required to check in with authorities or go through the full legal process to determine their asylum status.

The administration's goal is to manage the massive backlog of asylum cases and prioritize cases involving security risks. By terminating certain cases early, they aim to streamline the system and focus on more critical issues. However, this might give the impression that migrants can remain in the U.S. without facing legal consequences, which could potentially encourage more illegal immigration.

Obviously, this approach has been viewed as controversial, but it’s a broken system, and this administration is trying to tackle a very tough issue that no other president has been able to address effectively. It’s a tough balancing act, and the characterization and demonizing done by the article is just rage baiting. It doesn't give the real intent and is meant to mislead and manipulate. We need to look at the bigger picture and understand the complexities involved in fixing our immigration system.

It’s by design.",1717430664,1,Republican
"The assertion that Biden’s policies are a threat to America is not supported by facts. In reality, the administration's approach to immigration is designed to make the system more efficient and secure, aligning with America First ideals. 

First, streamlining the asylum process and removing individuals who pose security risks more quickly helps manage resources more effectively and enhances national security. This approach ensures that those who could be a threat are dealt with promptly, which directly contributes to the safety of American citizens.

Second, an efficient and fair immigration system supports the American economy. Immigrants who follow the legal process fill critical roles in various industries, boosting economic growth and contributing significantly to the workforce. Denying them entry while indirectly benefiting from their labor through illegal means is both hypocritical and detrimental to our economic interests.

Furthermore, claims that the administration’s intent is to import a new voting block are speculative and unsupported by evidence. The focus on creating a more organized and lawful system ensures that only those who are eligible and meet stringent criteria are allowed to stay. This approach balances compassion with strict enforcement, providing protection to those in genuine need while maintaining rigorous security measures.

Lastly, the assertion that more Americans will die due to these policies ignores the fact that a well-regulated system with clear rules and swift enforcement actually reduces chaos and enhances public safety. A fair and humane approach to immigration does not mean leniency; it means efficiency and security.

In essence, Biden’s policies aim to strengthen the nation by making the immigration system work more effectively, which is in line with the principle of putting America first by fostering both security and prosperity. It’s time to look beyond the simplistic rhetoric and understand the complexities involved in creating a system that truly benefits the country.

It seems to me currently right leaning folks seem to only want to hamper effective government policy’s under the guise of “small government” and then complain about its ineffectiveness or efficiency… if everyone would pull their heads out of their asses they could objectively look at policies proposed. I used to be of the same view as you but I’ve taken it upon myself to understand the issue entirely from both ends of the spectrum or at least try to… I’m sure there’s nothing Biden could do to appease those who are on the trump band wagon but for myself as an independent… not a fan of either president but in some cases and policies on of both presidents I can agree and get on board.

"I use perplexity mostly. I’ll just do a small example from our thread: AI says that “Biden's policies are a threat to America is not supported by facts” That is biased. It then says that the policies are designed to make the system more “efficient and secure”. 

Let’s tackle “secure” first. Biden’s immigration policies are note making the border secure. In fact it’s the exact opposite: “President Biden's immigration policies have indeed made the U.S. southern border less secure, leading to a historic crisis with record-high illegal border crossings”. That is from perplexity. 

Now let’s do “efficient”. Without AI i actually agree with this, and that’s the problem. We don’t need/want more efficiency. We want less. Especially if Biden is just going to set them free with no accountability (the point of the article).

[Masonic Fraternal Police Department (MFPD)](https://hatch.kookscience.com/wiki/Masonic_Fraternal_Police_Department_(MFPD))

>The Masonic Fraternal Police Department was a Masonic-type organisation based in Santa Clarita, California under the leadership of David Inkk Henry (Grandmaster Henry X°, Illuminati Grandmaster X°) that came to media attention after Henry and two fellow members, Brandon Kiel, Henry's son-in-law and a community affairs liaison to then-Attorney General of California Kamala Harris, and Tonette Hayes/Henry, a minister and former ombudsman, were arrested in 2015 on charges impersonating police officers. The group, associated with the Most Worshipful Illustrious Scottish Knight Grand Supreme Council,[i] was described by its membership as being the inheritors of the Knights Templar, claiming a lineage dating back some three thousand years, and offered their services to ""Masonic Sovereign Grand Masters and their Masonic Jurisdictions, as well as other Fraternities, Sororities and Greek Organizations,"" and planned to expand into, presumably in addition to their HQ, ""33 other states, including Mexico City.""[ii] It was associated with, or considered a successor to, Henry's earlier Masonic Investigative Bureau (MIB).

"> Secondary thought, do you believe there's an area in the country a truly non-bias jury existed for prosecuting a former President? Let alone one as polarizing as Trump?

There are certainly places where the jury pool is closer to 50/50, and that's about as good as you are going to do if you have an unbiased judge.

> I will say I'm shocked it was unanimous on all counts, I would've guessed at least a few not guilty charges out of 34.

It wasn't really 34 separate crimes.  It was 34 copies of the same crime, so guilty on one was going to be guilty on all.

Further, the prosecution never specified which underlying crime Trump committed (he was never actually charged with any of them), and the judge's instructions to the jury were illegal.

Per SCOTUS, a jury must agree on all elements of a crime, including any underlying crime to render a guilty verdict.

The judge's instructions to the jury in the Bragg case said they didn't have to do that, they just had to agree that *one* of the possible underlying crimes applied.

That set up a situation where 8 jurors could have said that Trump wasn't guilty of any one underlying crime, and still get a conviction on all counts.",1717522611,4,Republican
"That's one way to put it. Another way to put it would be, ""known lie and perjury by the president & his son was finally proven with concrete evidence""",1717525574,1,Republican
"The jury candidates are randomly selected. The judge(s) decides which jurors to include based on arguments made by the prosecution and defense. Both sides have the ability to excuse jurors without stating a reason. This same process was used in Trump’s trial. Of course, the venue could have an effect. If you are pulling jurors from Manhattan, maybe they tend not to like Trump or favor Biden. But it is Trump’s hometown and where his business is based. That’s how the system works. If you don’t like it you will have to rewrite the constitution. 

“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed…”

In the Hunter case, both judges assigned to the trial are Trump appointees. So you have two Trump appointees deciding this jury. The article you referenced claims a family friend is included in the jury. That juror was not included. The one who claimed marijuana use should not disqualify a person from gun ownership qualified the statement by saying heroin is different. I’m not going to go through each one, but I invite you to read the actual details: 

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/live-blog/rcna154957?page=1#live-blog

In any case, I find it hard to understand how someone with a family member who has a drug problem is disqualifying. Hunter is not being tried for having a drug problem. He is being tried for lying on his taxes and saying he didn’t use drugs on his gun permit form. It appears the prosecution did not have a problem with the jurors with drug problem relatives either or they would have disqualified them. No explanation needed. 

This is how our system has worked since the country’s founding. Can you imagine the level of conspiracy that would have to take place to have a defense attorney, a prosecution, two judges, and all the clerical and administrative people who support them rigging the jury? Did they all get together in a smoke filled room with Biden and Hillary and George Soros and concoct this elaborate scheme to include people on the jury with alcoholic fathers? It strains all credibility. 

Even Lindsay Graham today said the average American wouldn’t be prosecuted for the gun offense. In fact, there are arguments that this law is contrary to the second amendment. But this is why we have courts and jurors. Innocent until proven guilty. All the way to the Supreme Court. 

And regarding your other question, I have no idea if Hunter’s trial timing is politically motivated. I couldn’t care less. If he is guilty then he should be convicted. The best way to avoid getting convicted of a crime is to not commit the crime. This goes for both Hunter and Trump. It’s a neat trick. 

I hope it is evident that I’m not a bad person. I don’t think you are either. I just worry that we are all allowing talking heads and opinion writers and conspiracy theories to turn us into enemies. I certainly have plenty of criticisms of Biden. Plenty. And I agree with plenty of things Trump did. And maybe I’ve bought into some conspiracy theories and didn’t even know it. 

Did Trump’s hush money trial get extra attention because of who he is? Probably. Maybe he wouldn’t even have been prosecuted for that crime if he weren’t Trump. The same goes for Hunter. But when you put yourself in the spotlight, when you chant “lock her up” at rallies and use your power and voice to sow doubt in our institutions for your own gain, or when you are the presidents son with a drug problem, you are going to get a lot of attention. I have no idea if Hunter is guilty. If the Burisma thing has some truth to it. That’s why we have courts. I’ll tell you for a fact that Sean Hanity and Rachel Maddow sure as hell don’t know. They make money by selling outrage. I think Maddow deals in facts more often than not, and I’m sure you disagree, but that’s not worth some kind of civil war or burning the place down. They are just rich talking heads. 

If you don’t trust our judicial system then there isn’t a country left. If you don’t trust our elections then we don’t have a democracy. If that’s how you feel then I’m truly sorry. Anyway, I got way off topic. I’m not going to respond to this anymore because I’m sure we can go round and round all day. Maybe I’ll see you around. I’m sure we will smile and say hi and please and thank you. We probably aren’t all that different.",1717538341,2,Republican

*There are a few problems with that idea.*

1.	⁠It isn't a crime.  The FEC already tried to prosecute John Edwards for this when he was running for President and paid off his mistress for her silence.  The court ruled that there were reasons independent of a campaign that a prominent figure might want to protect his reputation.
2.	⁠The Democrats already brought this accusation to the FEC and US Attorney, and both of them declined to prosecute it - because it isn't a crime.
3.	⁠The business records they're saying were improperly recorded in order to influence the election were recorded after the election, so they couldn't have influenced it.

So you don't know anything about our political parties other than the propaganda.

For example, you don't know that the Womens' suffrage movement was Republican, and that all the Suffragettes voted Republican, because it was the Democrats that were fighting against it.

...and you don't know that it is the Democrats forcing the allowance of men into womens' sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms, and who insist that men can be better women than women.

As regards minorities, you don't know that it was the Democrats who seceded to form the Confederacy to fight for the right to own black people, or that when they lost that war, they created the KKK to prevent black people from voting, and when Reconstruction ended 9 years later, created the Jim Crow laws to as closely recreate slavery as possible without *actually* owning people.  They opposed the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution (which were necessary because Democrats kept making laws to take rights away from black people), fought against civil rights legislation for the next century, watering it down when they couldn't prevent it from passing, and opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  They spent the next decade opposing desegregation, to the point that a Republican President had to use Federal troops to enforce it in Democratic states.  Planned Parenthood, which Democrats support universally, was founded for the purpose of aborting black babies, and Margaret Sanger, its founder, routinely gave speeches to the KKK.  Now that they've successfully kept the US black population at 13% of the US population for decades, they figured out that they needed a new slave group - so they've been mass importing illegal aliens.  One of their big focuses now is the sexualization, steriliztion, and mutilation of young children - something that even the UK is now backing away from.

"Comey leaked a lot more than ""Memo 4"".  Among other things, he requested a personal, one-on-one meeting with Trump, briefed him on the Steele Dossier, and then leaked that to the press.  The press, which had previously passed on reporting on the Steele Dossier (despite Clinton shopping it around to every media outlet), used the classified briefing as a hook to report on it.  Of course we now know that the FBI already knew it was a product of the Clinton campaign and that there was nothing to corroborate it, even though they had offered Steele large amounts of money for corroborating evidence, and had done their own investigations.  As to the Clinton announcement, he had no choice - the NY field office found the information and was threatening to inform Congress themselves, because Comey had already delayed informing them for 60 days.

McCabe - yes, they dropped the leak case.  SOP for the DOJ is that whenever someone in the DOJ is caught in something sufficiently bad to send them to prison for decades, that person resigns and the DOJ drops the case.  Because Trump was President, he was fired for leaking classified information to the press and lying to investigators about it, and lost his pension.  When Biden took office, he was given $250,000 to cover his legal fees (this was a straight gift, since his legal fees had been paid by donations), and his pension was reinstated.

Strzok and Page - hilarious that they sued for 'invasion of privacy' when it was Strzok's wife who brought the texts to the attention of the DOJ because she found them on his phone, which she was looking at because she suspected he was having an affair (he was, with Page).  Both resigned from the DOJ, and of course were not prosecuted for any of the myriad crimes they committed.

Clinesmith was prosecuted only because Trump was still President.  His sentencing was delayed until after Trump lost the election - and for falsifying evidence to obtain a FISA warrant, his sentence was a 12 months probation and 400 hours of community service.  He wasn't even disbarred.

Manafort was indeed convicted and imprisoned - again, for a ""crime"" the DOJ had previously decided to not prosecute, and which the Podesta brothers had been allowed to retroactively file paperwork on to avoid prosecution.

"> Did you read the judge's instructions to the jury before they went into deliberations? It details the charges, the criteria for each charge to found guilty, and what is alleged. 

Yes, they were illegal.  SCOTUS has ruled that a jury must agree on ALL elements of a crime including any underlying charges, in order to convict.  The judge told the jury they did not have to do that, but only agree that Trump was guilty of only one of the underlying charges, and they didn't have to agree on which.

> In this case, the instructions were that the felony charge was falsifying business records for the purpose of covering up another crime.

Yep.  ...but Trump was never charged with or convicted of any other crime that could have elevated the business records charges to a felony.  Further, two of the ""possible"" crimes were Federal crimes that both the Federal Election Commission and US Attorney had chosen to not charge, and on which the statute of limitations had expired.  The third one was a state crime which Trump had *also* never been charged with and on which the statute of limitations had expired.  Ergo, not only had he not been charged with any of the predicate crimes, he *couldn't be* charged with them.

> As I understand it (not a lawyer), the crime being covered up is not something that had to be charged and convicted

Yep.  IMO that alone should be grounds for appeal, since Trump was convicted of a crime based on the imagination of the prosecutors that Trump had committed some other crime, without any requirement that the commission of other crime be proved.  That should fail on due process grounds, even if the jury instructions *weren't* illegal.

> First, that the payments via Cohen were executed for a political purpose, and as such would have been considered an undeclared political contribution to the campaign.

...which the Federal Election Commission attempted to prosecute John Edwards for when he did it while running for President, and the courts ruled wasn't a political contribution, and thus not illegal.  That's why the FEC chose to not charge Trump when the Democrats ran to them with it.  Incidentally, the judge prohibited the former FEC director from testifying to that fact.

> Second, that the records were submitted to the IRS for tax purposes, and that knowingly submitting data to the IRS is a crime in and of itself.

A Federal crime that the US Attorney chose to not charge, because the business records weren't improperly recorded in the first place.  ...which incidentally means even the misdemeanors don't exist.

That said, the prosecution didn't say which crime Trump had committed that elevated the misdemeanors to felonies - because they couldn't.

"Ok, I'm sorry I'm absolutely not a Republican, and really not a right winger, but I randomly found this post and I'm going to try to answer it in the most neutral way possible for someone who doesn't know French politics. So I'm sorry if you wanted a quick summary but you won't get it.


I'm going to start with some important historical context. First, imagine if the US President could, at any time, decide to call early elections because he's not satisfied with the balance of power in the legislative assembly. For context French legislative election happen every 5 years at once, generally two months after the Presidential election.

**Historical Context :**

 This wasn't always the case though, as legislative elections used to  happen every 5 years, and presidential elections every 7 years, which would desynchronise them. As a consequence, we used to have ""cohabitations"" (""roommate situations"") during which the President was from one side, and the Prime Minister from another.  In 2000, we passed a law (1st used in 2002) to reduce the presidential mandate to 5 years. This had the intended effect of reducing political instability, because when a President would take office, if the opposition was the majority in the chamber, the President would just call for new elections, so you sort of had 2 legislative elections over 7 years. This also had the unintended effect of massively strenghtening the President, because now that he always has a supportive assembly, the President who has been directly elected by the people, is now responsible for his campaign promises, and as such unofficially gets both the President and the Prime minister powers.

Also, Macron built his power on the ruins of the two ""Main"" parties of the Vth Republic, the Socialist Party and the UMP. They went from sharing the power between each other for decades, to 1.7% for the Socialist Party and slightly below 5% for the UMP (by then called LR or ""Republicans"", which is the name I'll use later) in 2022. 

**Balance of power before the election :**

Finally, the current situation. First you have to understand that Macron had a very clear majority in 2017, and while he was well liked with his party, he's absolutely HATED by those both on the left and the far right. Like straight up despised. Before Macron, President François Hollande left office with litterally 2% approval ratings, while Iirc Macron was at 18% or maybe slightly over 20% after his mandate in 2022. But Hollande was disliked by the 98% left, while Macron is despised by most of the other 80%. And I really can't stress enough how hated he is. But in 2022, while Macron was elected against Le Pen, first, he was elected on much thinner margins. In 2017 : 66% Macron, 34% Le Pen. 2022 : 58% Macron, 41% Le Pen. Second, he wasn't given a majority, which had never been the case before in the history of the Vth Republic for a President who just got elected. And a lot of people were happy with that result, even among Macron supporters, because they believed it would do him good to have to find agreements with other parties

**What happened on Sunday and why Macron decided to dissolve the National Assembly ?**


Two years later, european elections happen and as you saw it, he's got less than half of Le Pen's votes, and is barely hanging in there in 2nd position (15%) with the former Socialist Party at 14.5% just behind him. This is a legitimacy blow. You can afford to lose by a decent margin, and even by a lot, but certainly not by that much, and certainly not against what was for decades the most hated party in the country. The legitimacy of the President comes from the fact that he's the only one elected by a national popualr vote, meaning his legitimacy is somewhat ""more legitimate"" than any other. A member of parliament has *a share* of popular legitimacy, the share held by his constituency. The president is elected by everyone else. But his election was two years ago already, and now he's been utterly defeated. And after the summer, there are going to be budget talks, and the Republicans have publicly said that for the first time they would vote against the confidence to the government, which would have meant the Prime Minister would have to resign, and tradition (but not law) demands that he dissolves the Parliament to let the people decide. By dissolving right now, he avoids  another humiliation two months from now and takes everyone by surprise with no chance to campaign. So his bet had two sides from what I can see. The far right kept asking for a dissolution, and he always refused. But he finally does it, and we get barely 20 days to campaign. Second, everyone is shocked by the RN results, and the right of the Socialist Party and most of the Republicans have no choice but to join hands with him to avoid being wiped out. So, to force the hand of the more ""centrist"" parties, traditionnally more pro-EU.  The other hand is that, even if he loses and the RN got the majority, he stays President (so basically leaves domestic policies to Le Pen and keeps International policy to himself), the RN get impopular while in power, and in 2027 his legacy is intact because he's prevented Marine Le Pen from winning the presidency.


**The Left :**


Except, his entire plan failed. In the hour after he announced it, the leaders of the Socialist Party were organizing a meeting with every party on their left to unite once more, after they already did on very unfavorable terms in 2022 (since they got 1.7% and the other big left party 22%) and the more ""right-wing"" share is split between joining that union on conditions, and those who want to stay alone. Everyone know that deciding to unite with Macron is a political death sentence, so no one is going to do it. The pressure from their base is far too strong and even if they hate each other, their militants actually don't, and the first one to break that unity would get shattered and that wouldn't leave a dent on the strenght of the alliance.


**The Right :**


And on the right, things got absolutely bonkers and, if anything, made the far right stronger. the Republicans were hurt the most by Macron, because while the first followers of Macron came from his original party (the Socialist Party), the vast majority of those who joined him later were from the Republicans. So, already, all those who wanted to join him already did. Second, there's a real resentment that Macron blew their party up, the historically most powerful party of the fifth republic, and all of those who stayed got elected on a platform of joining neither Macron nor Le Pen. But yesterday, the President of the Republican Party unilaterally decided that his party would ally with the RN. Instantly, the entire party refused. Turns out he's leaving with two people : the head of the youth movement of the party, and the #2 on the European list. Everyone else has opposed him and called for his head. This lead to absolutely insane scenes today of the president of the party locking himself up in their offices, telling every party worker to go home and refusing to abidcate, while the meeting of the ""Bureau Politique"" (Idk how to call it, but basically the most important people in the party) unanimously decided to kick him out. Except, they can't legally do it since their meeting must have been called up ... by the Party president, the same one who has locked himself up in their office and refuse to let them enter to have their meeting. Eric Ciotti (the Party president) says the party members support him, and he's ready to call an election ... that would happen weeks after the legislative elections, while the party needs to designate his candidates before the end of the week.

**What now ?**

He's obviously going to try to fight, but I think he's quite doomed. He wants to campaign, but his MPs don't want him to show up and some have said that they refuse to use his picture for their campaign. They had a ""relative majority"" (less than half the seats but more than any other party or alliance of parties), and they're most likely going to be wiped out. The left will get significant gains if the union doesn't fail (but so far so good), but should get less than Le Pen. Le Pen right now should get about 250 seats, which is still less than half by a significant margin, and she most likely won't be able to ally with the Republicans considering the current events. No side will ever want to govern with any other, so we're looking at a potential locked parliament with no possible prime minister and a Regime crisis.

If you have any follow up questions, feel free to ask, I would love to share what is happening in here because I'm sure it's going to make the news more often quick enough. I could talk for hours about the ""Popular Front"" (the name of the left wing alliance) and its history, why the Republicans refuse to join hands with the RN, but also why did Ciotti accepted to make that deal with them, or why Macron is as hated as he is and how he's most likely lost the loyalty of his entire followers because he's fucked them over.

And I expect a Christian president to reduce federal taxes below 10%",1718578725,-1,Republican
">Where paying proper wage is socialism?

Well, let's look at this question in some detail.  What is a core element of socialism that is relevant to this situation?  The core element is government control.  Socialism mandates ""public ownership of the means of production"" which sounds nice and pretty when stated that way, but it only ever takes one form, government control.  So, when you say you want a proper wage, how that manifests is government control of private businesses' compensation rates.  That's one element of socialism inherent in your question, though I completely understand if you had no intention of it being a question that pointed in the direction of socialism.  I'm just pointing out how someone more free market minded can see the socialism inherent in your suggestion.  

>I mean demand / offer law.

Here you would have to qualify what you mean, exactly, because words like ""demand"" and ""offer"" and ""labor"" and plenty of others have unfortunately had their meanings muddied in a terrible way by advocates of various political philosophies.  A socialist who uses the term ""labor"" absolutely does **not** mean the same thing as a capitalist who uses the term ""labor.""  And that's the sort of thing that gets them talking past each other most of the time. 

>And I expect a Christian president to reduce federal taxes below 10%

Now this part of your post doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  There's nothing in the Christian or the Jewish faiths that would limit a government's take of your income to ten percent or less.  In fact, the Christian New Testament details a story of Jesus being asked about paying taxes, and his response was ""give unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and give unto God what is God's.""  So, obviously the Christian faith draws a distinction between what Jehovah asks of you and what the government asks of you, and it clearly commands Christians to pay both in full.  God asks Christians for ten percent, and they have to give unto Caesar (the government) what is Caesar's.  And the New Testament also says that the Christian God honors in heaven whatever laws are passed on Earth, and the Jewish faith details how God never intended for man to have a ruling government but cursed them to be under the thumb of one for the rest of their days because the people demanded a king to make decisions for them.  I don't know what you read that made you think a Christian would only want less than 10% tax rates.  There's nothing in the Torah or the Bible to support that at all.",1718590668,2,Republican

> We recovered from that, and have exceeded total employment.

Of course we have.  The US population is still growing organically, and we've added (at least) 10 million illegal aliens since Biden became President.

All those new jobs went to illegal aliens.  Interestingly the Business jobs survey and household survey, which normally track each other, have quit doing that for the last few years.

Businesses report new jobs, but the Household survey asks how many people are working.  Those who can are often holding two or three jobs to make ends meet - and that counts as one person employed in the Household survey.

> Not your problem.

Good for me, personally.  I'm not hiring or managing people anymore, and 20 years ago, someone my age would have been put out to pasture.  Now they can't do without me.

> do you know what professionalism means?

For starters, it means showing up on time.  Every day.  ...and not being on your phone playing games or texting instead of working, and dressing appropriately for the job, and not refusing to work because you don't like that your employer is not bowing to <lefty cause of the week>, and not making public statements embarrassing your employer, and giving your employer good value for their money - all things that many of the younger set seem to have trouble with.

> And they are wildly overskilled, twice as many people with stem degrees as there are stem degrees available.

No, they are over*educated*.  Turns out that when colleges dumb down their courses to keep people enrolled who are wholly unprepared to do college level work, all education there suffers.

That's why a lot of employers no longer hire based on the degree, but instead have technical interviews regardless of the supposed skills of the applicant.  ...technical interviews that a lot of those supposedly skilled applicants can't pass.

> NO ONE CARES how the specific snowflake business that runs a oddball machine made in 1985 handles its own internal processes

The people at that business care - and they care that an applicant for a job working on that machine has the basics necessary to be trained in its operation.  When it hires people who don't, disasters occur, that those of us who *do* have the basics (and the advanced knowledge) need to solve.

> they better be ready to cough up the cash to have someone trained, AND pay them well enough they're willing to hang around.

Nobody gives a damn that your snowlake ass expects to be well paid, if you don't have the skills and ability to deserve that pay.  Entry level jobs don't pay well, because the point of those jobs is for you to learn enough to be worth more than your wages.  When you excel at the entry level job, you'll have the opportunity to advance to a position that requires more skill and has more responsibility and higher pay.

"Calling the US a democracy is BARELY more than a placebo. We are philosophically a flawed democracy at best, being a democracy with local votes on mill levies and such.

Sure, we vote on “some” officials, but even the presidency is based on the electoral college which is barely accounted as a democratic action, just barely… and the nature of Congress and the party system that enables the candidates to be chosen from erodes any reasonable notion of claiming the voting on these as actions of democracy. Yet the unelected bureaucracy does the vast majority of the governance legwork.

The notion of democracy is / has been shifting through time.

We are functionally a Federal Presidential Republic, with democratic philosophies dabbled here and there.

The vast majority of all governance is not decided by democratic action of the people, but rather but quasi-elected officials and the unelected bureaucracy. Even the “elected officials” are mostly spoon-fed selections chosen and offered by the powers-that-be on all sides of the political spectrum.

Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have been the only real populist choices that have bubbled to the top. RFK jr. is debatable as to being included as a populist candidate anymore than most independent or third party candidates. The vast majority of “elected” officials have been filtered and groomed through the channels of power.

The current discussion of “Democracy” is more about some people trying to change the nature of the system rather than describing the system as it is or as it has been.

You can call it the US a democracy if it makes you feel better, but I challenge you to point to the democratic actions beyond the aforementioned “quasi-elected officials” and local ballot issues you have directly voted on.
