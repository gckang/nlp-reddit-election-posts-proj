I\u2019d caution calling him a democrat. He *gave* us Trump.\n\nComey was definitely a Democrat operative (though at the time he claimed to be a Republican.  He didn't leave the party until after he tried to overthrow Trump's Presidency and got caught).\n\nAs to Comey's October Surprise announcement, he didn't have much choice.  Comey wrote the statement exonerating Clinton seven months before he gave it on national TV, and long before the investigation was seriously underway.  Peter Strzok changed the wording in that statement so that it no longer called her behavior \"grossly negligent\" (which happens to be the standard for the statute that Comey was exonerating her on), and instead called it \"extremely careless\".\n\nAfter Congress subpoenaed Hillary's emails and she illegally had the server wiped in response, the only way they were able to find out what was on the server was to get the recipients of her emails to send anything that they had been copied on.  Since the lefties in the Federal government did not want to cooperate, the investigation naturally got a very incomplete set of emails.  It was that incomplete set that Comey originally exonerated Hillary for on the basis that she didn't *intend* to send thousands of classified documents over an unclassified network.  Never mind that the statute doesn't require intent, you aren't supposed to know that.  You also aren't supposed to know about all the *other* felonies she committed, like having her staff remove the cover pages from classified documents so they could be sent over unclassified networks, or deliberately sending classified information to people who had been explicitly denied a security clearance, or having her IT guy (who was not cleared to see classified information) print out the classified emails and bring them to her.  All of that was water under the bridge, thanks to Comey's July 2016 statement, and she had clear sailing to the election.\n\nThere was just one problem.  In NYC, the NY Field Office was busy investigating former Rep. Anthony Wiener for sexting with a 15 year old girl.  They got his laptop and discovered something unexpected: hundreds of thousands of emails from Hillary's private email server - a much more complete copy than Congress had.  It turns out that Wiener was married to Huma Abedin, Hillary's top aide - and she had sent a copy of all Hillary's emails to Wiener's laptop - which included hundreds of thousands of emails subpoenaed by Congress that Hillary had deleted and Congress hadn't been able to recover.  The NY Field Office reported this to FBI HQ in DC and... nothing.  30 days went by.  Then 60.  Finally the NY Field Office issued an ultimatum: Either the DC FBI inform Congress of the emails, or the NY Field Office would.  That forced Comey's hand, which is why he made the announcement that the investigation had been re-opened.\n\nStrzok (there's that name again) was given the task of examining the 400,000 new emails for classified emails, and voila!  Two weeks later, Strzok reported that the metadata of all the emails had been examined and that the emails were just more copies of what they already had, and no new classified emails had been recovered.\n\nTurns out that was not one, not two, but three lies.\n\n1. He couldn't process the emails using the metadata because the metadata was corrupt.\n\n2. Because the metadata was corrupt, all of the emails had to be individually examined.  ...and only 3000 of the 400,000 emails were examined during those two weeks.\n\n3. More than a dozen previously unknown classified emails were discovered among those 3000.\n\nSo, Comey made his *second* statement exonerating Clinton, which was just as much of a lie as the first one.\n\nA few honest men threw a wrench into Comey's plan to make the classified emails go away, but he did the best he could.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1717204886, "created_utc": 1717204886, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l6k9574", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1d4tn85", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l6k9574", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_l6k7me5", "permalink": "/r/Republican/comments/1d4tn85/republicans_should_do_to_democrats_what_they_did/l6k9574/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1717204902, "saved": false, "score": -2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Republican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qndt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Republican", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": -2, "user_reports": []}

This policy could lead to a lack of oversight because these individuals are no longer required to check in with authorities or go through the full legal process to determine their asylum status.\n\nThe administration's goal is to manage the massive backlog of asylum cases and prioritize cases involving security risks. By terminating certain cases early, they aim to streamline the system and focus on more critical issues. However, this might give the impression that migrants can remain in the U.S. without facing legal consequences, which could potentially encourage more illegal immigration.\n\nObviously, this approach has been viewed as controversial, but it\u2019s a broken system, and this administration is trying to tackle a very tough issue that no other president has been able to address effectively.

In reality, the administration's approach to immigration is designed to make the system more efficient and secure, aligning with America First ideals. \n\nFirst, streamlining the asylum process and removing individuals who pose security risks more quickly helps manage resources more effectively and enhances national security. This approach ensures that those who could be a threat are dealt with promptly, which directly contributes to the safety of American citizens.\n\nSecond, an efficient and fair immigration system supports the American economy. Immigrants who follow the legal process fill critical roles in various industries, boosting economic growth and contributing significantly to the workforce. Denying them entry while indirectly benefiting from their labor through illegal means is both hypocritical and detrimental to our economic interests.\n\nFurthermore, claims that the administration\u2019s intent is to import a new voting block are speculative and unsupported by evidence. The focus on creating a more organized and lawful system ensures that only those who are eligible and meet stringent criteria are allowed to stay. This approach balances compassion with strict enforcement, providing protection to those in genuine need while maintaining rigorous security measures.\n\nLastly, the assertion that more Americans will die due to these policies ignores the fact that a well-regulated system with clear rules and swift enforcement actually reduces chaos and enhances public safety. A fair and humane approach to immigration does not mean leniency; it means efficiency and security.\n\nIn essence, Biden\u2019s policies aim to strengthen the nation by making the immigration system work more effectively, which is in line with the principle of putting America first by fostering both security and prosperity. It\u2019s time to look beyond the simplistic rhetoric and understand the complexities involved in creating a system that truly benefits the country.\n\nIt seems to me currently right leaning folks seem to only want to hamper effective government policy\u2019s under the guise of \u201csmall government\u201d and then complain about its ineffectiveness or efficiency\u2026 if everyone would pull their heads out of their asses they could objectively look at policies proposed.

Biden\u2019s immigration policies are note making the border secure. In fact it\u2019s the exact opposite: \u201cPresident Biden's immigration policies have indeed made the U.S. southern border less secure, leading to a historic crisis with record-high illegal border crossings\u201d.

Especially if Biden is just going to set them free with no accountability (the point of the article). \n\nPerplexity: \u201cNo, President Biden's immigration policies are not making border crossings more efficient - they are fueling an unprecedented crisis of illegal immigration that is overwhelming border security and enforcement resources.\u201d\n\nSo you can\u2019t just say by you posting AI responses somehow I\u2019m the one spreading fake news and untruths.

If you don\u2019t like it you will have to rewrite the constitution. \n\n\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed\u2026\u201d\n\nIn the Hunter case, both judges assigned to the trial are Trump appointees. So you have two Trump appointees deciding this jury. The article you referenced claims a family friend is included in the jury. That juror was not included. The one who claimed marijuana use should not disqualify a person from gun ownership qualified the statement by saying heroin is different. I\u2019m not going to go through each one, but I invite you to read the actual details: \n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/live-blog/rcna154957?page=1#live-blog\n\nIn any case, I find it hard to understand how someone with a family member who has a drug problem is disqualifying. Hunter is not being tried for having a drug problem. He is being tried for lying on his taxes and saying he didn\u2019t use drugs on his gun permit form. It appears the prosecution did not have a problem with the jurors with drug problem relatives either or they would have disqualified them. No explanation needed. \n\nThis is how our system has worked since the country\u2019s founding. Can you imagine the level of conspiracy that would have to take place to have a defense attorney, a prosecution, two judges, and all the clerical and administrative people who support them rigging the jury? Did they all get together in a smoke filled room with Biden and Hillary and George Soros and concoct this elaborate scheme to include people on the jury with alcoholic fathers? It strains all credibility. \n\nEven Lindsay Graham today said the average American wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted for the gun offense. In fact, there are arguments that this law is contrary to the second amendment. But this is why we have courts and jurors. Innocent until proven guilty. All the way to the Supreme Court. \n\nAnd regarding your other question, I have no idea if Hunter\u2019s trial timing is politically motivated. I couldn\u2019t care less. If he is guilty then he should be convicted. The best way to avoid getting convicted of a crime is to not commit the crime. This goes for both Hunter and Trump. It\u2019s a neat trick. \n\nI hope it is evident that I\u2019m not a bad person. I don\u2019t think you are either. I just worry that we are all allowing talking heads and opinion writers and conspiracy theories to turn us into enemies. I certainly have plenty of criticisms of Biden. Plenty. And I agree with plenty of things Trump did. And maybe I\u2019ve bought into some conspiracy theories and didn\u2019t even know it. \n\nDid Trump\u2019s hush money trial get extra attention because of who he is? Probably. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t even have been prosecuted for that crime if he weren\u2019t Trump. The same goes for Hunter. But when you put yourself in the spotlight, when you chant \u201clock her up\u201d at rallies and use your power and voice to sow doubt in our institutions for your own gain, or when you are the presidents son with a drug problem, you are going to get a lot of attention. I have no idea if Hunter is guilty. If the Burisma thing has some truth to it. That\u2019s why we have courts. I\u2019ll tell you for a fact that Sean Hanity and Rachel Maddow sure as hell don\u2019t know. They make money by selling outrage. I think Maddow deals in facts more often than not, and I\u2019m sure you disagree, but that\u2019s not worth some kind of civil war or burning the place down. They are just rich talking heads. \n\nIf you don\u2019t trust our judicial system then there isn\u2019t a country left. If you don\u2019t trust our elections then we don\u2019t have a democracy. If that\u2019s how you feel then I\u2019m truly sorry. Anyway, I got way off topic. I\u2019m not going to respond to this anymore because I\u2019m sure we can go round and round all day. Maybe I\u2019ll see you around. I\u2019m sure we will smile and say hi and please and thank you.

Among other things, he requested a personal, one-on-one meeting with Trump, briefed him on the Steele Dossier, and then leaked that to the press.  The press, which had previously passed on reporting on the Steele Dossier (despite Clinton shopping it around to every media outlet), used the classified briefing as a hook to report on it.  Of course we now know that the FBI already knew it was a product of the Clinton campaign and that there was nothing to corroborate it, even though they had offered Steele large amounts of money for corroborating evidence, and had done their own investigations.  As to the Clinton announcement, he had no choice - the NY field office found the information and was threatening to inform Congress themselves, because Comey had already delayed informing them for 60 days.\n\nMcCabe - yes, they dropped the leak case.  SOP for the DOJ is that whenever someone in the DOJ is caught in something sufficiently bad to send them to prison for decades, that person resigns and the DOJ drops the case.  Because Trump was President, he was fired for leaking classified information to the press and lying to investigators about it, and lost his pension.  When Biden took office, he was given $250,000 to cover his legal fees (this was a straight gift, since his legal fees had been paid by donations), and his pension was reinstated.\n\nStrzok and Page - hilarious that they sued for 'invasion of privacy' when it was Strzok's wife who brought the texts to the attention of the DOJ because she found them on his phone, which she was looking at because she suspected he was having an affair (he was, with Page).  Both resigned from the DOJ, and of course were not prosecuted for any of the myriad crimes they committed.\n\nClinesmith was prosecuted only because Trump was still President.  His sentencing was delayed until after Trump lost the election - and for falsifying evidence to obtain a FISA warrant, his sentence was a 12 months probation and 400 hours of community service.  He wasn't even disbarred.\n\nManafort was indeed convicted and imprisoned - again, for a \"crime\" the DOJ had previously decided to not prosecute, and which the Podesta brothers had been allowed to retroactively file paperwork on to avoid prosecution.\n\n> J6 terrorists. I have zero sympathy for anyone that violently attacked our Capitol.\n\nAgreed - so why were the FBI agents and assets who did that and who instigated the riot given a pass for doing so?  Why were people who did nothing violent put in prison for years?  Are you justifying the government witnesses lying on the stand and falsifying evidence, the prosecution withholding exculpatory evidence and spying on privileged communications, and judges preventing the juries from being told this?", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1717967477, "created_utc": 1717967477, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l7vd5of", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1db54m8", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l7vd5of", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_l7v6njn", "permalink": "/r/Republican/comments/1db54m8/breaking_alvin_bragg_agrees_to_testify_in/l7vd5of/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1717967494, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Republican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qndt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Republican", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": []}

It details the charges, the criteria for each charge to found guilty, and what is alleged. \n\nYes, they were illegal.  SCOTUS has ruled that a jury must agree on ALL elements of a crime including any underlying charges, in order to convict.  The judge told the jury they did not have to do that, but only agree that Trump was guilty of only one of the underlying charges, and they didn't have to agree on which.\n\n> In this case, the instructions were that the felony charge was falsifying business records for the purpose of covering up another crime.\n\nYep.  ...but Trump was never charged with or convicted of any other crime that could have elevated the business records charges to a felony.  Further, two of the \"possible\" crimes were Federal crimes that both the Federal Election Commission and US Attorney had chosen to not charge, and on which the statute of limitations had expired.  The third one was a state crime which Trump had *also* never been charged with and on which the statute of limitations had expired.  Ergo, not only had he not been charged with any of the predicate crimes, he *couldn't be* charged with them.\n\n> As I understand it (not a lawyer), the crime being covered up is not something that had to be charged and convicted\n\nYep.  IMO that alone should be grounds for appeal, since Trump was convicted of a crime based on the imagination of the prosecutors that Trump had committed some other crime, without any requirement that the commission of other crime be proved.  That should fail on due process grounds, even if the jury instructions *weren't* illegal.\n\n> First, that the payments via Cohen were executed for a political purpose, and as such would have been considered an undeclared political contribution to the campaign.\n\n...which the Federal Election Commission attempted to prosecute John Edwards for when he did it while running for President, and the courts ruled wasn't a political contribution, and thus not illegal.  That's why the FEC chose to not charge Trump when the Democrats ran to them with it.  Incidentally, the judge prohibited the former FEC director from testifying to that fact.\n\n> Second, that the records were submitted to the IRS for tax purposes, and that knowingly submitting data to the IRS is a crime in and of itself.\n\nA Federal crime that the US Attorney chose to not charge, because the business records weren't improperly recorded in the first place.  ...which incidentally means even the misdemeanors don't exist.\n\nThat said, the prosecution didn't say which crime Trump had committed that elevated the misdemeanors to felonies - because they couldn't.  Because they couldn't *charge and convict* him of those crimes, alleging that he had committed them would be slander - and then libel when they put it into official court documents.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 1, "created": 1718142141, "created_utc": 1718142141, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l86i3ok", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1ddhqmj", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l86i3ok", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_l86e1gl", "permalink": "/r/Republican/comments/1ddhqmj/jury_verdict_hunter_biden_guilty_on_all_three_gun/l86i3ok/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1718142159, "saved": false, "score": 0, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Republican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qndt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Republican", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 0, "user_reports": []}

So I'm sorry if you wanted a quick summary but you won't get it.\n\n\nI'm going to start with some important historical context. First, imagine if the US President could, at any time, decide to call early elections because he's not satisfied with the balance of power in the legislative assembly. For context French legislative election happen every 5 years at once, generally two months after the Presidential election.\n\n**Historical Context :**\n\n This wasn't always the case though, as legislative elections used to  happen every 5 years, and presidential elections every 7 years, which would desynchronise them. As a consequence, we used to have \"cohabitations\" (\"roommate situations\") during which the President was from one side, and the Prime Minister from another.  In 2000, we passed a law (1st used in 2002) to reduce the presidential mandate to 5 years. This had the intended effect of reducing political instability, because when a President would take office, if the opposition was the majority in the chamber, the President would just call for new elections, so you sort of had 2 legislative elections over 7 years. This also had the unintended effect of massively strenghtening the President, because now that he always has a supportive assembly, the President who has been directly elected by the people, is now responsible for his campaign promises, and as such unofficially gets both the President and the Prime minister powers.\n\nAlso, Macron built his power on the ruins of the two \"Main\" parties of the Vth Republic, the Socialist Party and the UMP. They went from sharing the power between each other for decades, to 1.7% for the Socialist Party and slightly below 5% for the UMP (by then called LR or \"Republicans\", which is the name I'll use later) in 2022. \n\n**Balance of power before the election :**\n\nFinally, the current situation. First you have to understand that Macron had a very clear majority in 2017, and while he was well liked with his party, he's absolutely HATED by those both on the left and the far right. Like straight up despised. Before Macron, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande left office with litterally 2% approval ratings, while Iirc Macron was at 18% or maybe slightly over 20% after his mandate in 2022. But Hollande was disliked by the 98% left, while Macron is despised by most of the other 80%. And I really can't stress enough how hated he is. But in 2022, while Macron was elected against Le Pen, first, he was elected on much thinner margins. In 2017 : 66% Macron, 34% Le Pen. 2022 : 58% Macron, 41% Le Pen. Second, he wasn't given a majority, which had never been the case before in the history of the Vth Republic for a President who just got elected. And a lot of people were happy with that result, even among Macron supporters, because they believed it would do him good to have to find agreements with other parties\n\n**What happened on Sunday and why Macron decided to dissolve the National Assembly ?**\n\n\nTwo years later, european elections happen and as you saw it, he's got less than half of Le Pen's votes, and is barely hanging in there in 2nd position (15%) with the former Socialist Party at 14.5% just behind him. This is a legitimacy blow. You can afford to lose by a decent margin, and even by a lot, but certainly not by that much, and certainly not against what was for decades the most hated party in the country. The legitimacy of the President comes from the fact that he's the only one elected by a national popualr vote, meaning his legitimacy is somewhat \"more legitimate\" than any other. A member of parliament has *a share* of popular legitimacy, the share held by his constituency. The president is elected by everyone else. But his election was two years ago already, and now he's been utterly defeated. And after the summer, there are going to be budget talks, and the Republicans have publicly said that for the first time they would vote against the confidence to the government, which would have meant the Prime Minister would have to resign, and tradition (but not law) demands that he dissolves the Parliament to let the people decide. By dissolving right now, he avoids  another humiliation two months from now and takes everyone by surprise with no chance to campaign. So his bet had two sides from what I can see. The far right kept asking for a dissolution, and he always refused. But he finally does it, and we get barely 20 days to campaign. Second, everyone is shocked by the RN results, and the right of the Socialist Party and most of the Republicans have no choice but to join hands with him to avoid being wiped out. So, to force the hand of the more \"centrist\" parties, traditionnally more pro-EU.  The other hand is that, even if he loses and the RN got the majority, he stays President (so basically leaves domestic policies to Le Pen and keeps International policy to himself), the RN get impopular while in power, and in 2027 his legacy is intact because he's prevented Marine Le Pen from winning the presidency.\n\n\n**The Left :**\n\n\nExcept, his entire plan failed. In the hour after he announced it, the leaders of the Socialist Party were organizing a meeting with every party on their left to unite once more, after they already did on very unfavorable terms in 2022 (since they got 1.7% and the other big left party 22%) and the more \"right-wing\" share is split between joining that union on conditions, and those who want to stay alone. Everyone know that deciding to unite with Macron is a political death sentence, so no one is going to do it. The pressure from their base is far too strong and even if they hate each other, their militants actually don't, and the first one to break that unity would get shattered and that wouldn't leave a dent on the strenght of the alliance.\n\n\n**The Right :**\n\n\nAnd on the right, things got absolutely bonkers and, if anything, made the far right stronger. the Republicans were hurt the most by Macron, because while the first followers of Macron came from his original party (the Socialist Party), the vast majority of those who joined him later were from the Republicans. So, already, all those who wanted to join him already did. Second, there's a real resentment that Macron blew their party up, the historically most powerful party of the fifth republic, and all of those who stayed got elected on a platform of joining neither Macron nor Le Pen. But yesterday, the President of the Republican Party unilaterally decided that his party would ally with the RN. Instantly, the entire party refused. Turns out he's leaving with two people : the head of the youth movement of the party, and the #2 on the European list. Everyone else has opposed him and called for his head. This lead to absolutely insane scenes today of the president of the party locking himself up in their offices, telling every party worker to go home and refusing to abidcate, while the meeting of the \"Bureau Politique\" (Idk how to call it, but basically the most important people in the party) unanimously decided to kick him out. Except, they can't legally do it since their meeting must have been called up ... by the Party president, the same one who has locked himself up in their office and refuse to let them enter to have their meeting. Eric Ciotti (the Party president) says the party members support him, and he's ready to call an election ... that would happen weeks after the legislative elections, while the party needs to designate his candidates before the end of the week.\n\n**What now ?**\n\nHe's obviously going to try to fight, but I think he's quite doomed. He wants to campaign, but his MPs don't want him to show up and some have said that they refuse to use his picture for their campaign. They had a \"relative majority\" (less than half the seats but more than any other party or alliance of parties), and they're most likely going to be wiped out. The left will get significant gains if the union doesn't fail (but so far so good), but should get less than Le Pen. Le Pen right now should get about 250 seats, which is still less than half by a significant margin, and she most likely won't be able to ally with the Republicans considering the current events. No side will ever want to govern with any other, so we're looking at a potential locked parliament with no possible prime minister and a Regime crisis.\n\nIf you have any follow up questions, feel free to ask, I would love to share what is happening in here because I'm sure it's going to make the news more often quick enough. I could talk for hours about the \"Popular Front\" (the name of the left wing alliance) and its history, why the Republicans refuse to join hands with the RN, but also why did Ciotti accepted to make that deal with them, or why Macron is as hated as he is and how he's most likely lost the loyalty of his entire followers because he's fucked them over.

What is a core element of socialism that is relevant to this situation?  The core element is government control.  Socialism mandates \"public ownership of the means of production\" which sounds nice and pretty when stated that way, but it only ever takes one form, government control.  So, when you say you want a proper wage, how that manifests is government control of private businesses' compensation rates.  That's one element of socialism inherent in your question, though I completely understand if you had no intention of it being a question that pointed in the direction of socialism.  I'm just pointing out how someone more free market minded can see the socialism inherent in your suggestion.  \n\n>I mean demand / offer law.\n\nHere you would have to qualify what you mean, exactly, because words like \"demand\" and \"offer\" and \"labor\" and plenty of others have unfortunately had their meanings muddied in a terrible way by advocates of various political philosophies.  A socialist who uses the term \"labor\" absolutely does **not** mean the same thing as a capitalist who uses the term \"labor.\"  And that's the sort of thing that gets them talking past each other most of the time. \n\n>And I expect a Christian president to reduce federal taxes below 10%\n\nNow this part of your post doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  There's nothing in the Christian or the Jewish faiths that would limit a government's take of your income to ten percent or less.  In fact, the Christian New Testament details a story of Jesus being asked about paying taxes, and his response was \"give unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and give unto God what is God's.\"  So, obviously the Christian faith draws a distinction between what Jehovah asks of you and what the government asks of you, and it clearly commands Christians to pay both in full.  God asks Christians for ten percent, and they have to give unto Caesar (the government) what is Caesar's.  And the New Testament also says that the Christian God honors in heaven whatever laws are passed on Earth, and the Jewish faith details how God never intended for man to have a ruling government but cursed them to be under the thumb of one for the rest of their days because the people demanded a king to make decisions for them.  I don't know what you read that made you think a Christian would only want less than 10% tax rates.  There's nothing in the Torah or the Bible to support that at all.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1718590668, "created_utc": 1718590668, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l8y27cy", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1dhccbj", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l8y27cy", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_l8xbil6", "permalink": "/r/Republican/comments/1dhccbj/trump_encourages_voters_to_write_no_tax_on_tips/l8y27cy/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1718590684, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Republican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qndt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Republican", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": []}
