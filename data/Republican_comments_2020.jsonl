Now the user above I think may have conflated a few ideas, because you are half right. In 1995 began a stretch of Republican control in both congress and the senate for 12 years. Prior to that, Congress was majority Democrat since the 30's except for a couple two year periods. Since the mid 90's it have bounced back and forth a bit, though it was majority Republican for most of it.\n\nSo the idea that democrats have perpetually been in control is not that far off. But the user I think conflates that with some of the states and the democrat control of those states.\n\nIf you look at [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party_strength_in_California), just before 1959 the Republicans had control almost exclusively. From 1959, Democrats had pretty much complete control of who they sent to congress and the senate, as well as the California state assembly and senate. There were a few pockets of Republican executives in the state, but they **always** presided over a Democrat controlled legislature.\n\nIf you look at [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party_strength_in_New_York) you see a similar pattern, but it was a little less obvious. It turn pretty solidly blue in almost all facets of government in the mid 1970's. There was still a lot of red until the late 90's, then aside from a George Pataki, the only bit of red is in the state senate, which has held on since then, but is waning. And the last term it was blue as well.\n\nIllinois has been about 50/50 since around the 20's, then in 2000 it shifted entirely to blue at the state and federal level. New Jersey, aside from Chris Christie as Governor, has been entirely blue since about 2000. Maryland has been almost completely blue since the mid 1800's. Since the late 90's Washington has gone from about 50/50 to solid blue.\n\nAnyway, our point is that these are all strongholds for Democrats, all of which have many cities in awful shape where the most unrest occurs in our country. When you look at red states, because there are red states with massive cities with unrest, if you look at the actual control in the counties where those big cities reside and the cities themselves, you see a similar pattern of Democrat control. Houston is in the middle of one of the reddest states in the Union right now, but it has had a Democrat mayor since 1982.\n\nTexas is an especially interested case study. Texas as a state almost entirely blue at the state and federal level until you start seeing some major cracks in the early 90's and then in the mid-90's it went hard into red.\n\nConsider this, people are fleeing California and New York, many of whom are going to Texas. So over the past 20-30 years, Blue states have declined to the point that people want to leave, be it for quality of life, living expenses, or just bad governance, and they are choosing to go to a state that became red and stayed red and has gotten stronger since it turned red.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1591015660, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fsisc6a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gu9hq4", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_fshvdej", "permalink": "/r/Republican/comments/gu9hq4/flying_over_la_right_now/fsisc6a/", "quarantined": false, "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1596946753, "score": 6, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Republican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qndt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Republican", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "name": "t1_fsisc6a", "ups": 6}

We aren\u2019t silent. Even so, you don\u2019t get to tell us how to react. (Funny thing is no matter what is said by a conservative, no matter how sympathetic it is, some democrat will find fault with it.) We don\u2019t give a crap what you think because you\u2019ve (falsely) called us racists for 20 years now and as far as we are concerned, the race card has been played out.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1591141291, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fsovpk5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_guudpz", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_fsoq1b2", "permalink": "/r/Republican/comments/guudpz/independent_autopsy_finds_george_floyd_died_of/fsovpk5/", "quarantined": false, "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1597058334, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Republican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qndt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Republican", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "name": "t1_fsovpk5", "ups": 1}

Neither can all the white folks who post pleasant sentiments on facebook saying they stand with BLM. They say we need to speak up when racism happens. WE DO.

Nothing. It has no teeth right now, and when it does have teeth, you know what's going to happen? A cop who did nothing wrong is going to be canned because of the perception.

When we look at the population by race (Whites comprise about 60% of the population compared to 14% for Blacks according to the U.S. Census) we can expect whites killed to be four times higher than blacks. This isn\u2019t true because we can assume that there are good apples and bad apples in each race so we must take into consideration police interactions instead of population. If we look at the crime rates for each race (according to the FBI and the DOJ investigation under the Obama Presidency) we can see that the violent crime rate within the black community is about half that of the white community which reflect the Fatal Officer Involved Shootings (FOIS) report that you provided. Ultimately, we have many issues within our society that need addressed in order to prevent the destruction and division that we are seeing with George Floyd\u2019s murder.   \n\n1. We need to realize that all protesters aren\u2019t necessarily rioters and looters. \n2. We need to realize that all cops aren\u2019t bad cops. Instead of blaming the entire police force for the actions of a few bad apples, we need to hold the individuals accountable. \n3. We need to have a solid leadership within this country that is willing to respect the rule of law while also acknowledging sources of marginalization and injustice. \n4. We need to all learn what respect is again. In today\u2019s day and age, it is far too easy to sit behind a keyboard and forget about the human on the other end.\n5. We need to stop seeing race, ethnicity, and religion in everything we do. While the horrors of slavery are something that can never be reconciled, we must also remember that the institution was abolished over a 150 years ago. While certainly all people weren\u2019t equal until the 70\u2019s, we must move on and acknowledge that it is the past or history is certain to repeat itself. We must also remember that whites aren\u2019t entirely to blame for the horrors of slavery, blacks willingly sold blacks and Hispanics held slaves in the Caribbean. \n6. We must realize that in saying one race is more important than another simply because there is adversity in one specific nation, at one specific time in history, we are marginalizing all other races and creating racial disparities (the exact thing that is supposedly being fought). ALL LIVES DO MATTER whether your black, brown, white, orange, blue, elderly, unborn, middle aged, a teenager, Catholic, Muslim, Buddhist, straight, gay, bi, etc. \n7. We need law and order. For those arguing that protesters and rioters/looters are not the same, then you must be willing to show the cops this and do just as much to prevent it as they are or you\u2019re just enabling criminals and thereby becoming synonymous with them. Additionally, police need to see the difference between the different entities too and in a lot of cases, I think both sides are starting to see this. Additionally, we need a government that is going to be willing to step in and squash this violence without stepping on our God-given rights.\n\n[census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219#qf-headnote-a) \n\n[FBI Crime Statistics ](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018) \n\nEdit: Provided links for Census and FBI crime data.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1591223682, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1591224029, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "fssq9mo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gvshbe", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_fss5gy5", "permalink": "/r/Republican/comments/gvshbe/family_of_st_louis_police_captain_david_dorn/fssq9mo/", "quarantined": false, "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1597133215, "score": 6, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Republican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qndt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Republican", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "name": "t1_fssq9mo", "ups": 6}

Now we\u2019re at a stalemate. \n\nI never said YOU felt the protests were wrong, but there\u2019s no denying that a vast majority of right wing news outlets and the president are  guilty of branding all the protests as violent when in reality it\u2019s a very very small proportion of the people there that act like that, and in many cases these protests only turn violent after police show up and begin tear gassing and beating protesters.

If people have a problem that you voted for President Trump, they can go cry it out with their therapist. Social media is full of the types of people who think they can tell you who to vote for. Screw them. \n\nTrump has had his ups and downs. Even before he became president there was a line to dogpile him and prevent him from becoming president. Foreign media groups compared him to Hitler, domestic media groups compared him to Hitler, these groups are all in the pockets of the political Left. Once he became president there was a massive movement to discredit his presidency, pissed lefties crying \"#notmypresident\" on Twitter as they pissed and moaned through all of 2017 and 2018 and 2019, here we are in 2020 and they are still pissing and moaning. \n\nSo about President Trump: \n\nHis policies are very pro-USA. He loves this country, and he does what he thinks is in the best interests of the long-term health of the USA. This includes being tough on China and providing incentives to remove supply chains from the Chinese mainland in the interest of national security and economic prosperity of the United States and our allies. He is very pro-worker and pro-small business, and his policies reflect that. \n\nHis tax cuts were seen by the left as a \"gift for the rich at the expense of the poor\" but that's not true. They claim it's \"trickle down economics\" but there is no such thing as trickle down economics, and trickle down economics is a term made up by the opponents of supply-side economics, the Keynesians. The goal of these tax cuts was to spur domestic investment and to create American jobs. It has shown to work, but we're in the middle of a crisis. Your parents probably appreciated his tax cuts, they would have made life easier for owners of small businesses. \n\nHe talks way too much on Twitter. He's very narcissistic and self-centered. He is very much like we are, he's not one of the political elite. He reads the same news stories we read, and he gets some things wrong. \n\nThe political left has gone insane. \n\nJoe Biden isn't a leader, he's a dumpster fire. He probably raped Tara Reade, who accused him of raping her. Unlike the dozen or so accusers of Trump who had no corroborating evidence of wrongdoing until conveniently after he decided to run for president, Reade has been telling her story since it happened. Unlike Christine Blasey Ford, who can vaguely remember anything about the night she was supposedly sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh and his friend, Tara Reade had her mother on national television corroborating her story. The people who say \"They believe Tara Reade, but are still voting for Joe Biden\" are insane. \n\nJoe Biden is part of the reason police brutality exists at the level it does today. He co-authored the 1994 \"tough on crime\" bill, which has done good and bad things. Opponents say it lead to mass incarcerations of black people in the 1990's as it did provide funds to expand correctional facilities and surge hire police officers. These very people who are pissed off and demonstrating outside of the White House think this is all Trump's fault, as they prepare to vote for Joe Biden. \n\nWe're stepping on eggshells on social media because the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, and others are all catering to the PC crowd. Most mainstream media organizations cater to center-left to hard-left readers. You can expect some level of spin to any story about Donald Trump. You can expect front-page opinion editorials comparing Trump to Hitler, calling him fascist, racist, and anything they can get away with to pull voters to the Democrat Party. The media can print almost anything it wants with few repercussions. Worse still, PolitiFact, factcheck dot org, and Snopes are all run by politically biased liberals. \n\nVote for who you think will run this country better. It's very fashionable when you're young to vote for the liberal democrats. I voted Democrat when I was your age, before I started college and developed the capacity to think critically. Back then, all of the Democrat policies sounded great. They sounded like they knew how to create good paying jobs and how to get people more money for working them.

We support Donald Trump for the following reasons:\n\nHe has been the only Presidential candidate of the last 30 years to understand that the United States has been like a ship in the ocean with no destination, rudderless and led by dithering, vacillating captains.\n\nHe understood that this country unforgivably bled jobs, treasure, and legitimacy to a brutal dictatorship while our leaders not only did nothing, *they contributed to those conditions.*\n\nHe understood that enforcing realistic immigration controls is the only way to prevent an eventual civil and political breakdown of the country. \n\nHis leadership, persuasiveness, and business savvy led to the greatest economic expansion since World War II. This *after* a stuttering, simpering 'recovery' of 8 years. \n\nHis foresight in trying to end foreign entanglements in the Middle East and elsewhere, in forcing our allies to either honor their alliances with us or end them instead of preserving them just for appearances is also a big positive.\n\nHis support for real racial reform in the country was another big plus for me supporting him. While others talk about civil rights, Donald Trump got it done. Thousands of people have him to thank for their release from Federal prisons from harsh and unjust sentencing guidelines.\n\nFinally, there is the new normal of american politics: the alternative is far worse. Joe Biden is demented. That's not an insult, that's a diagnosis. Joe Biden will be replaced in the first year of being President should he win, and the Democratic Party is planning on installing Kamala Harris as his Vice-President in order to put a radical who couldn't even win 8 percent support in her own party as the President of the United States.\n\nThe democratic party today stands for recession, repression, and regression. Their view of the country is one in which individuals are crushed by a mob goaded to and from issues by an elite and fed watered down beer and slim pickings to keep them satiated. It is a party that is base and repugnant for anyone that believes in the principles of \"All men are created Equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.\"\n\nThe democratic party wants people to believe that the *government* gives you your rights. The truth is that man is blessed with natural rights, such as freedom to speak your mind, to pursue your own happiness, to defend yourself, to be free to live regardless of your color or creed. \n\nThey want you to forget about these natural rights and instead think of the rights of a prisoner.

Unlike most free market Republicans, Trump has imposed more trade protectionism via tariffs on imported goods from our allies (not just China, which is a justified instance). Propping up uncompetitive industries domestically via taxation is inherently anti-free market. I suggest you read Adam Smith\u2019s Wealth of Nations for a better understanding of free market capitalism and trade. Trump\u2019s impulsive use of government restrictions on international commerce is much closer to Bernie Sanders in that regard.\n\nHe\u2019s also very heavy-handed with levying government intervention against companies he has a personal grudge against (tech companies especially, which are America\u2019s most innovative segment). Another example of Trump\u2019s authoritarian approach to free market capitalism. Again at odds with conservative free market ideals.\n\nTrump\u2019s redemption in the economy is mostly the work of congressional Republicans. The tax cuts, the repeal of big government intervention in certain industries.\n\n> pro-America when it comes to foreign policy\n\nNot even remotely close to Reagan on this one. Trump has actively worked to dismantle the US-led Western power structure which secured our position as a dominant superpower for 80 years. Aside from his tough stance on China (which has been great and much needed) Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been predominantly anti-US and anti-West.\n\n> he's usually right about China\n\nAgreed, this is refreshing. Aside from the tax cuts this is his other major appeal for me.\n\n> Middle East\n\nHis track record is mixed here. Killing Soleimani was a big win. Abandoning the Kurds in Syria was a massive mistake. General Mattis was right to oppose such a cowardly move that led to thousands of Christians/Kurdish allies being slaughtered by Assad.\n\n> At his core he is just America first and not a \"globalist\" like Obama and Bush were.\n\nIt\u2019s a good slogan, but he\u2019s certainly much less \u201cAmerica first\u201d than Reagan. Trump has undermined American interests abroad and attacked Pax Americana. The \u201cglobalist\u201d trope is a fascinating reframing of the [anti-Atlanticist propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics#Content) from our adversaries. In this way, Trump is at odds with Reagan foreign policy.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember Trump was not a Republican until he ran for president and although he often aligns with our agenda he isn\u2019t really a conservative himself. The man is a radical departure from Ronald Reagan in several ways. \n\nThere are many instances when Republicans are able to get Trump back on track with policy, but sometimes he goes his own way.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1591677687, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1591681144, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "ftg1vk4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gz7bip", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_ftf5sqh", "permalink": "/r/Republican/comments/gz7bip/first_time_voter_why_should_i_vote_for_president/ftg1vk4/", "quarantined": false, "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1597572095, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Republican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qndt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Republican", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "name": "t1_ftg1vk4", "ups": 1}

I know a lot about this one, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is because Hoover was a prolific author and wrote more than any other president we've ever had. \n\nThe short version is that the Great Depression was an inevitable consequence of the Great War and Woodrow Wilson's decision to join it.  To fund the war, he created the IRS and the Federal Reserve, which created new risks in the market.  But more importantly, our involvement in the war allowed France and Britain to be vindictive at the negotiating table.  The result was that Germany wound up owing the US a lot of money that it used to pay Britain and France.  America went into recession, banks hounded Germany to pay up, they couldn't, recession got way worse, Germany got way worse, etc.  \n\nHoover inherited a system that was primed for disaster.\n\nOn to Nixon.  Nixon inherited two things from Johnson's administration.  The first was a brewing situation with OPEC due to the Yom Kippur war.  The second was Johnson's expansion of social entitlement programs.  Both of these were liabilities, but what really hurt Nixon was appointing Arthur Burns to the Federal Reserve.  Burns did not have the fortitude for the job, which requires a person willing to tell the president no sometimes.  It wasn't in Nixon's nature to appoint someone he couldn't manipulate. \n\nCarter gave the job to Paul Volcker.  Was better for the job, but his method of fixing the monetary problems, combined with Reagan's military spending, lead to serious interest increases that hit consumers and particularly farms.  Where Nixon's crisis was inflation and caused mostly by him picking a weak Fed, Reagan's big recession was driven by lending prices due to Carter leaving him a very tough Fed.  \n\nAt the very end of his administration, Reagan appointed Greenspan.  Now, Greenspan was hailed as a genius and served through Bush the elder, Clinton, and Bush the lesser.  Bush the elder and Greenspan hatched on the idea of \"ownership society\", which resulted in massive increases in home prices.  \n\nHowever, Bush was a neocon and was challenged by Ross Perot (who was kind of a proto-Trump).  Perot got a massive percentage of the vote, giving the election to Clinton.  Without Perot, Bush would have won and taken credit for the first half of the 90's economic miracle.  \n\nBut it wasn't a miracle.  Greenspan was creating MULTIPLE massive asset bubbles, the housing bubble and the internet bubble.  Clinton shares blame because he thought it was good too.\n\nThe internet bubble was guaranteed to hit whoever won in 2000.  Valuations had gone too high.  \n\nAnd the housing bubble was guaranteed to hit as soon as boomers slowed down buying houses.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1591678881, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "ftg3gqp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gz7bip", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_ftfxivp", "permalink": "/r/Republican/comments/gz7bip/first_time_voter_why_should_i_vote_for_president/ftg3gqp/", "quarantined": false, "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1597572847, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Republican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qndt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Republican", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "name": "t1_ftg3gqp", "ups": 3}

If that's the case then why do numerous Democrats grudgingly admit he's been good for the economy? It's been three years and change. If Trump was bad for the economy then he would have crashed it by now but it took a pandemic to even put a speed bump in the road for it. Now, last week when we were supposed to see a loss of 9 million more jobs we actually gained three million. Was that three million job gain Obama's doing too? I doubt it. I've also heard numerous Democrats openly hope for a recession so that Trump won't look good on the economy and lose in November. That's some pretty sick thinking to want people's lives destroyed just so you can win an election.\n\nNow for the pandemic. The claim that he didn't respond in time has already been debunked by the Associated Press, who are no lovers of Trump by any means. He reacted quickly and shut down travel from China while Democrats were urging people to attend parades in NYCs Chinatown. Your party called him racist for that. The only reason it didn't work is because the virus had already been around for a while at that point and China was hiding the information on it (see link below, one of many stories indicating it was around earlier than reported). Once we knew it was going strong here, what was the Democrats response? House sick people in nursing homes so that thousands of elderly people died.\n\nAs far as Trump being the one to sew the seeds of distrust causing 11 days of protest, that's also a very dubious claim at best. I recall President Obama falsely accusing a white police officer of racial profiling just after taking office (Henry Gates case), defending Trayvon Martin who we now know beyond a shadow of a doubt had actually assaulted George Zimmerman (not that Zimmerman was acting smart in that situation but we do know for a fact that he was walking away from the situation and never mentioned Trayvon's race until asked by the dispatcher), and then shook his finger at Dallas PD officers while lecturing them on how they needed to do better after a BLM activist murdered four of their own. I recall watching that particular little gem of his and wondering how on earth he could have the gall to stand there at a police funeral and lecture the police that it was their fault they got murdered by someone in a group he supported. So no, I'm sorry, but race relations were bad back then too. Trump has created more minority opportunity in the country than Obama did so as far as I'm concerned he's done plenty of good there.\n\nAnd while on the topic of division, Trump has also reversed many of Obama's antisemitic policies. He's acknowledged Jerusalem belongs to Israel and moved the embassy there. He's stopped the policy of appeasement toward Iran. He's stood up to antisemitism in the UN. All of that is the mirror opposite of what Obama did. Meanwhile your party puts antisemites like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib front and center of your policies.\n\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/public-global-health/501621-researchers-satellite-images-hint-coronavirus-started", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1591707212, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "ftgzaj3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_gz7bip", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_ftgdm0u", "permalink": "/r/Republican/comments/gz7bip/first_time_voter_why_should_i_vote_for_president/ftgzaj3/", "quarantined": false, "removal_reason": null, "retrieved_on": 1597588816, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Republican", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qndt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Republican", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "name": "t1_ftgzaj3", "ups": 2}
